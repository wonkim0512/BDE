She released her self-titled debut CD in 1990. She won a Juno Award in 1991 for Most Promising Female Vocalist.Early years.A native of Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada, Sue Medley was signed to Polygram Records Canada in 1989 and released a self-titled debut CD in 1990. The album was co-produced by Medley and John Mellencamp producer Michael Wanchic and featured strong performances by John Hiatt\'s band The Goners. In Canada Medley\'s first single, Dangerous Times not only pushed her debut album to gold status within a few weeks of release, but was #1 on MuchMusic for two weeks, #1 on the Pop Adult charts for 12 weeks, in the Top 3 of the national album rock chart for six weeks, and earned her a SOCAN Songwriter of the Year Award for most airplay.On the heels of the singles Dangerous Times, Maybe the Next Time, Thats Life, and Love Thing, she toured North America the rest of the year opening for Bob Dylan and other high profile artists. Her second album, Inside Out, was once again co-produced by Medley and Wanchic and was aided by the musical help of slide guitarist Sonny Landreth and drummer Kenny Aronoff. The album, released in 1992, continued her radio success with a handful of additional singles and national tours with such artists as Tom Cochrane, Kim Mitchell and 54.40, keeping her in the spotlight. The first single When the Stars Fall became a hit on album radio and reached #2 on The Records chart (being locked out of #1 only by U2). In October 1992 she was invited by John Mellencamp to participate in the Bob Dylan Tribute at Madison Square Gardens in New York City, and performed a duet with Mellencamp on the classic Dylan track Like a Rolling Stone. Later that month she received a SOCAN award for her song Maybe the Next Time, which was one of the most played songs on Canadian radio in 1991.Dispute with Polygram.Her third album, however, would not be forthcoming. Following a two-year dispute with her record label over the songs that would comprise that release, she and Polygram parted ways. She retreated to her house near Bloomington, Indiana, and wrote and recorded much of the material that made up her independent release, Velvet Morning, which was released in February 2000 on Egg Records. Her profile received a boost after four of her songs were featured on the TV series Dawson\'s Creek.Recent activity.After the renewal of her profile with Dawson\'s Creek, Medley lived and worked in Los Angeles, teaching guitar and helping to develop a new generation of budding songwriters and recording artists. Medley recently returned to Canada, and is now writing and demoing new material for an upcoming release. She is currently represented by Inner Circle Management, an art and cultural industries consulting business, based in Regina, Saskatchewan. In 2011 she joined the horn driven band Time Well Wasted based in her home town of Courtenay, British Columbia. After two years, Medley left TWW to form her own band Sue Medley & The Back Road Band, and in July 2013 released the 3-song EP Sue Medley & The Back Road Band, and followed this with a full length album These Are The Days, both productions co-produced with former CBC Music Producer / Recording Engineer John Mang.

The song was performed thirteenth on the night, following Portugal\'s Simone de Oliveira with Sol de inverno and preceding Denmark\'s Birgit Brel with For din skyld. At the close of voting, it had received 15 points, placing 5th in a field of 18.The song is a love ballad, with Solo telling his lover that he feels the same way she does because of the closeness of their relationship. As he expresses it in the lyrics, Always remember: what you do/You\'ll see it again in my face.It was succeeded as Italian representative at the 1966 Contest by Domenico Modugno with Dio, come ti amo.There is a song by band Deerhoof of the same name.'),(7649292,'Jim_Collins_(American_football)','Jim Collins (American football).James Brian Collins (born June 11, 1958) is a former American football linebacker and National Football League Pro Bowler.Collins graduated from West Morris Mendham High School in the Class of 1976, where, as a Senior, he helped lead his high school football team to a still standing club record 8 shutouts and its only State Championship victory to date. He subsequently attended Syracuse University on a full athletic scholarship at linebacker. In 1980 Collins was an honorable mention All-American by the AP. He was later named to the Syracuse all-century team.Collins was selected in the 2nd round (43rd overall pick) of the 1981 NFL Draft at linebacker by the Los Angeles Rams. He played in the NFL for seven seasons with the Rams (19811988), and spent his final season with the San Diego Chargers (1989).Collins was considered a leader of the Rams\' defense of the mid-1980s. He made one appearance in the NFL Pro Bowl while with the L.A.

Specifically, assume a function x(t) to be defined on an interval [1,1] and discretized into N equidistant points on this interval. The fLT then yields the decomposition of x(t) into its spectral Legendre components,where the factor (2k+1)/N serves as normalization factor and L\'x(k) gives the contribution of the k-th Legendre polynomial to x(t) such that (ifLT)The fLT should not be confused with the Legendre transform or Legendre transformation used in thermodynamics and quantum physics.Legendre filter.The fLT of a noisy experimental outcome s(t) and the subsequent application of the inverse fLT (ifLT) on an appropriately truncated Legendre spectrum of s(t) gives a smoothed version of s(t). The fLT and incomplete ifLT thus act as a filter. In contrast to the common Fourier low-pass filter which transmits low frequency harmonics and filters out high frequency harmonics, the Legendre lowpass transmits signal components proportional to low degree Legendre polynomials, while signal components proportional to higher degree Legendre polynomials are filtered out.'),(11374610,'Ralph_Crane','Ralph Crane.Ralph Crane (fl. 1615  1630) was a professional scrivener or scribe in early seventeenth-century London. His close connection with some of the First Folio texts of the plays of William Shakespeare has led to his being called Shakespeare\'s first editor.Life.What little is known of Crane\'s life comes from his own writings. In 1621 he published a small collection of his own poems titled The Works of Mercy, Both Corporeal and Spiritual, which he dedicated to John Egerton, 1st Earl of Bridgewater. In the prefatory Proem to that volume, Crane indicated that he was a native Londoner, and the son of a successful member of the Merchant Taylors Company. He spent seven years as the law clerk to Sir Anthony Ashley, secretary of the Privy Council; Crane later became a scribe working mainly for attorneys. Thomas Lodge dedicated his Scylla\'s Metamorphosis to a Ralph Crane in 1589; this may have been the poet/scrivener. Crane turned to writing verse late in life, when he was oppressed by ill health and poverty.Shakespeare.E. A. J. Honigmann, in his edition of Othello, suggested that Othello should be added as a sixth play to that list; and a few other Folio texts (from Henry IV, Part 2 to Timon of Athens) have been proposed by individual scholars, though without winning wide acceptance. As a result, Crane\'s scribal peculiarities concerning stage directions, speech prefixes, punctuation and other specifics have received intense attention from generations of scholars, critics, and editors of Shakespeare.Others.Crane\'s work for the King\'s Men was not restricted to Shakespeare. (Or even to plays: he copied out the last will and testament of Richard Burbage.) The most notable of his other transcripts for the company may well be his MS. of The Witch, the Thomas Middleton play that has a significant relationship with Macbeth. Crane transcripts provided copy for several plays in the first Beaumont and Fletcher folio of 1647, including The False One, The Knight of Malta, The Prophetess, and The Spanish Curate. The 1623 quarto of John Webster\'s The Duchess of Malfi was almost certainly set into type from a Crane transcript.None of Crane\'s Shakespearean MSS. have survived; but Crane scripts of several other works are extant, in addition to the one for The Witch noted above. Two of the six extant MSS. of Middleton\'s A Game at Chess are from Crane\'s hand. (Crane consistently changed all of Middleton\'s uses of has to hath in those transcripts, illustrating the complexities involved in using discriminators like has/hath and does/doth in stylometry studies.) The play Sir John van Olden Barnavelt, never printed in its own era, survived to modern times in a single Crane manuscript. (In that instance, Crane did a good job of preserving Fletcher\'s distinctive pattern of textual and stylistic preferences.)Crane regularly produced what were called presentation manuscripts, copies of favored works for particular clients. On November 27, 1625 he sent his transcript of John Fletcher\'s play The Humorous Lieutenant to Sir Kenelm Digby. The extant manuscript of Ben Jonson\'s 1618 masque Pleasure Reconciled to Virtue, known as the Chatsworth MS., was a Crane presentation manuscript for Sir Dudley Carleton.'),(39397775,'Patrik_Barto%C5%A1%C3%A1k','Patrik Bartok.Patrik Bartok (born March 29, 1993) is a Czech ice hockey goaltender.

Within a few years of his presidency, many of Yeltsin\'s initial supporters had started to criticize his leadership, and Vice President Alexander Rutskoy even denounced the reforms as economic genocide.Ongoing confrontations with the Supreme Soviet climaxed in the 1993 Russian constitutional crisis in which Yeltsin illegally ordered the dissolution of the Supreme Soviet parliament, which as a result decided to try to remove him from office. In October 1993, troops loyal to Yeltsin stopped an armed uprising outside of the parliament building, leading to a number of deaths. Yeltsin then scrapped the existing Russian constitution, banned political opposition and deepened his efforts to transform the economy.On 31 December 1999, under enormous internal pressure, Yeltsin announced his resignation, leaving the presidency in the hands of his chosen successor, then-Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. Yeltsin left office widely unpopular with the Russian population.The election and inauguration.On June 12, 1991 Yeltsin elected as the first President of the Russian Federation, received 45,552,041 votes, representing 57.30 percent of the number who took part in the vote, and well ahead of Nikolai Ryzhkov, who, despite the support of the federal authorities, received only 16.85%. Together with Boris Yeltsin was elected a vice-president, Alexander Rutskoi. After the elections, Boris Yeltsin began the struggle with the privileges of the range and the maintenance of Russia\'s sovereignty within the USSR.These were the first in the history of Russian national presidential elections. On July 10, 1991 Boris Yeltsin brought an oath of allegiance to the people of Russia and the Russian Constitution and assumed the position of President of the Russian Federation. After taking the oath, he made a keynote speech, which began energetically and emotionally, understanding the solemnity of the time.The first decree, which was signed by Yeltsin, was the decree On urgent measures for the development of education in the Russian Federation. The document, prepared with the active participation of the Ministry of Education of the RSFSR, headed by ED Dnieper, outlined a number of measures to support, financially, the system of education, which were explicit declarative. Much of the declared in the decree have not been fulfilled, for example, promise to send abroad each year for training, internships, training not less than 10 thousand students, post-graduate students, teachers and academic staff.On July 20, 1991 Boris Yeltsin signed a decree No. 14 On the termination of activity of organizational structures of political parties and mass social movements in state bodies, institutions and organizations of the Russian Federation, which has become one of the final chords policy of partization and dedeologization. Yeltsin began to negotiate the signing of a new union treaty with Mikhail Gorbachev and the leaders of other Soviet republics.State Committee on the State of Emergency.On August 19, 1991, after the announcement of the creation of the State Committee on the State of Emergency and the isolation of Gorbachev in the Crimea, Yeltsin led the resistance to the Emergency Committee and made the Russian House of Soviets (The White House) as the center of resistance. On the first day of events Yeltsin, speaking from a tank outside the White House, called the actions of the State Emergency Committee a coup, then issued a number of decrees on non-recognition of the State Emergency Committee action. On August 23 Yeltsin signed a decree suspending the activities of the RSFSR, and on November 6, on the termination of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.After the failure of the Emergency Committee, and Gorbachev has returned to Moscow to negotiate a new Union Treaty are deadlocked, and Gorbachev finally began to lose control levers, which are gradually retreating to Yeltsin and heads of other union republics.Dissolution of the Soviet Union.In December 1991, Boris Yeltsin, Soviet President Gorbachev held a secret meeting with Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk and Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Belarus Stanislav Shushkevich, which led to negotiations on the establishment of the Commonwealth of Independent States. On December 8, 1991, the presidents of Ukraine, Russia and the Chairman of the Armed Forces of Belarus signed the Belavezha agreements on creation of the CIS, which states that the USSR, as a subject of international law and a geopolitical reality ceased to exist. The agreement was signed despite the referendum on preserving the Soviet Union, which took place March 17, 1991.On December 12, the agreement was ratified by the Supreme Council of the Russian Federation. The Russian parliament ratified the document by a large majority: 188 votes for with 6 votes against, and 7 votes were abstained. The legitimacy of the ratification caused doubts among some members of the Russian parliament, since according to the Constitution (Fundamental Law) of the RSFSR in 1978 consideration of the documents are in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Congress of People\'s Deputies, as it affects the character of the Republic as part of USSR and thus entailed changes in the Russian constitution. On December 21 the majority of the union republics joined to the Commonwealth after they signed the Alma-Ata Declarations and the Protocol to the Agreement on the establishment of the CIS.Alexander Lukashenko believes that the most negative consequence of the collapse of the USSR was the formation of a unipolar world. According to Stanislav Shushkevich in 1996, Yeltsin said that he regretted signing the Bialowieza agreements. On December 24, the President of the Russian Federation informed the Secretary General of the United Nations that the membership of the Soviet Union replacing by the Russian Federation which continues the membership in all organs of the United Nations (including membership in the UN Security Council). Thus, Russia is considered an original member of the United Nations (since 24 October 1945), along with Ukraine (SSR) and Belarus (Byelorussian SSR).On December 25, 1991, Boris Yeltsin, was full of presidential power in Russia in connection with the resignation of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and the actual collapse of the USSR. Following the resignation of Mikhail Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin had transferred his residence from the Russia\'s White House to the Kremlin and he received the so-called nuclear suitcase.In April 1992, 4th Congress of People\'s Deputies three times refused to ratify Belovezhskoe agreement and deleted from the text of the Russian Constitution mention of the constitution and laws of the USSR, which subsequently became one of the causes of the confrontation of the Congress of People\'s Deputies with President Yeltsin and later led to the dispersal of the Congress in October 1993. The USSR Constitution and laws of the USSR continued to be referred to in articles 4, 102 and 147 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation - Russian (RSFSR) in 1978 up to 25 December 1993, when in force adopted by a referendum the Constitution of the Russian Federation, which contained no mention of the Constitution and laws of the USSR.In September 1992, a group of People\'s Deputies, headed by Sergei Baburin sent to the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation a petition to examine the constitutionality of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR of 12 December 1991 On ratification of the Agreement establishing the Commonwealth of Independent States.Russian constitutional crisis.On December 10, 1992, the day after the Congress of People\'s Deputies did not approve the candidacy of Yegor Gaidar as Prime Minister, Boris Yeltsin issued a sharp criticism of the Congress of People\'s Deputies and tried to disrupt his work, calling on his supporters to leave the meeting hall. a political crisis has Began. After the talks, Boris Yeltsin and Ruslan Khasbulatov, Valery Zorkin and multi-voting, the Congress of People\'s Deputies on December 12 adopted a resolution on the stabilization of the constitutional system and Viktor Chernomyrdin was appointed as Prime Minister.After the eighth Congress of People\'s Deputies, which quashed the decision of the stabilization of the constitutional system and the decisions that undermine the independence of the government and the Central Bank, on March 20, 1993, Boris Yeltsin, delivered a televised address to the nation, he announced that it has signed a decree on the introduction of special operation mode. The next day, the Supreme Council appealed to the Constitutional Court, calling Yeltsin\'s appeal an attack on the constitutional foundations of the Russian state. The Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation, still not having signed the decree, and Yeltsin found the actions associated with the televised address, unconstitutional, and found that the reasons for his dismissal. The Supreme Council convened IX (Extraordinary) Congress of People\'s Deputies. However, as it turned out after a few days, in fact, it signed another decree contains no gross violations of the Constitution. On March 28, the Congress attempted to remove Yeltsin from his office as president. Speaking at a rally on Vasilyevsky Spusk, Yeltsin vowed not to implement the decision of the Congress if it will still be accepted. However, over the impeachment only 617 deputies has voted out of 1033, with the necessary 689 majority votes.The next day, after failing impeachment Congress of People\'s Deputies appointed April 25, All-Russian referendum on four issues: the confidence to President Yeltsin, on the approval of its socio-economic policies of the early presidential elections and early elections of people\'s deputies. Boris Yeltsin called on his supporters to vote yes four themselves supporters were inclined to vote yes-no-yes. According to the results of the referendum of confidence he received 58.7% of votes, while 53.0% voted in favor of the economic reforms. On the issue of early presidential elections and people\'s deputies for votes, respectively, 49.5% and 67.2% took part in the vote, however, legally significant decisions on these matters have been adopted (as, according to the laws in force, for this  for we had to speak out more than half of all eligible voters). Contradictory results of the referendum were interpreted by Yeltsin and his entourage in their favor.After the referendum, Yeltsin focused its efforts on the development and adoption of the new Constitution. On April 30 in the newspaper Izvestia was published on the presidential draft constitution on 18 May, it was announced the launch of the Constitutional Council, and on June 5 Constitutional Assembly gathered for the first meeting in Moscow. After the referendum, Yeltsin virtually ceased all business contacts with the leadership of the Supreme Council, although some continued to sign some time taken them laws, and has lost confidence in the Vice-President Alexander Rutskoi and freed him from all offices, and on September 1 he was suspended from office on suspicion of corruption.Press Freedom in Russia.After the fall of the Communist Party and the collapse of the USSR, in the initial period (1991-1993), The presidency of Boris Yeltsin, the level of freedom in the media has remained at the level of 1990-1991.First Chechen War.Officially, the conflict is defined as measures to maintain constitutional order, the military action called first Chechen war, less Russian-Chechen or Russian-Caucasian war. The conflict and the events preceding it were characterized by a large number of casualties, the military and law enforcement agencies, noted the facts of ethnic cleansing of non-Chechen population in Chechnya.Although certain military successes of the Russian Interior Ministry and the Russian Armed Forces, the outcome of this conflict was the withdrawal of Russian troops, the massive destruction and casualties, the de facto independence of Chechnya before the second Chechen war and a wave of terror that swept across Russia.With the beginning of perestroika in the various republics of the Soviet Union, including in the Chechen-Ingush Republic stepped various nationalist movements. One of these organizations was the established in 1990 National Congress of the Chechen People (NCCP), aims to exit Chechnya from the Soviet Union and the creation of an independent Chechen state. It was headed by a former general of the Soviet Air Force, Dzhokhar Dudayev.On June 8, 1991 at the II session of the NCCP, Dudayev proclaimed the independence of the Chechen Republic Nokhchi-cho. Thus, the country has developed a dual power.During the August Putsch in Moscow, the leadership of the Chechen Republic supported the Emergency Committee. In response to the events from September 6, 1991 Dudayev declared the dissolution of the national government agencies, accusing Russia of colonial policy. On the same day Dudaev Guardsmen storm seized the building of the Supreme Council, the television station and Radio House. More than 40 deputies were beaten, and the chairman of the Grozny city council Vitali Kutsenko thrown out the window, as a result he died.The Chairman of the RSFSR Supreme Soviet, Ruslan Khasbulatov, then sent them a telegram: I am pleased to have learned of the resignation of the Armed Forces of the Republic. After the collapse of the Soviet state, Dzhokhar Dudayev declared the final outlet of Chechnya from the Russian Federation.On October 27, 1991 in the country under the control of separatists held presidential and parliamentary elections. President of the Republic became Dzhokhar Dudayev. These elections have been declared illegal by the Russian Federation\'s officials.On November 7, 1991, Russian President Boris Yeltsin signed a decree On the state of emergency in the Chechen-Ingush Republic (1991). The situation in the country has deteriorated - the supporters of separatists surrounded the building of the Interior Ministry and the KGB, military camps, blocked rail and air hub. In the end, the introduction of state of emergency was thwarted, the decree On state of emergency in the Chechen-Ingush Republic (1991) was canceled on November 11, three days after its signing, after a heated discussion at the session of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR and Republic began the withdrawal of Russian military forces and units of the Interior Ministry finalized by the summer of 1992. Separatists start capturing and looting of military depots.Dudayev\'s forces got a lot of weapons. In June 1992, Defense Minister Pavel Grachev ordered to transfer half of Dudayev in existence in the country of weapons and ammunition. According to him, it was a necessary step, since a significant part of the transmission of weapons have been seized, and take the rest there was no way due to the lack of soldiers and trains. Even then, when Dudayev stopped paying taxes to the Russian budget and prohibited employees from entering the Russian special services in the republic, the federal government is officially continued to transfer money to Dudayev. In 1993, the Kaliningrad region has been allocated 140 million rubles to 10.5 billion rubles to Chechnya.Russian oil until 1994 continued to arrive in Chechnya. Dudayev did not pay for it, and resold abroad. Dudayev also got a lot of weapons: 2 rocket launchers ground troops, 42 tanks, 34 infantry fighting vehicles, 14 armored personnel carriers, 14 light armored tractor, 260 aircraft, 57 of thousands of small appliances and many other weapons.On November 30, 1994 Boris Yeltsin decided to send troops to Chechnya and signed a secret decree  2137 On measures to restore constitutional law and order in the Chechen Republic, and the Chechen conflict began.On December 11, 1994 on the basis of Yeltsin\'s decree On measures to curb the activities of illegal armed groups on the territory of the Chechen Republic and in the zone of the Ossetian-Ingush conflict began sending troops to Chechnya. Many ill-considered actions have led to heavy casualties among both military and civilian populations: tens of thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands were injured. It often happens that during a military operation, or shortly before it came from Moscow ordered the rebound. This allowed the Chechen rebels to regroup. The first storm of Grozny was ill-conceived and led to heavy casualties: dead and missing over 1,500 people, 100 were captured Russian soldiers.In June 1995, during the seizure of militias under the leadership of Shamil Basayev, hospitals and maternity hospital in Budennovsk, Yeltsin was in Canada, and decided not to stop the trip, providing an opportunity to Chernomyrdin to resolve the situation and negotiate with the militants, he returned only after all events, dismissed the heads of a number of law enforcement agencies and the Governor of the Stavropol Territory. In August 1996, Chechen rebels drove the Federal troops from Grozny. After that Yeltsin signed the Khasavyurt agreements, which many regarded as treacherous.Russian presidential election, 1996.The Presidential elections were held in Russia on 16 June 1996, with a second round on 3 July. The result was a victory for the incumbent President Boris Yeltsin, who ran as an independent candidate. Yeltsin defeated the Communist challenger Gennady Zyuganov in the run-off, receiving 54.4% of the vote. His inauguration ceremony took place on 9 August. There have been claims that the election was fraudulent, favoring Yeltsin.Second term.After the elections, Yeltsin has not seen in public due to the ill health for some time and did not appear before the voters. He appeared in public only at the inauguration ceremony on August 9 that took place in a highly abbreviated procedure because of Yeltsin\'s poor state of health.On 5 November 1996 Yeltsin underwent surgery coronary artery bypass surgery of the heart, during which Viktor Chernomyrdin has performed the duties of President. To work Boris Yeltsin did not return until the beginning of 1997.In 1997, Boris Yeltsin signed a decree on the ruble denomination, held talks in Moscow with Aslan Maskhadov and signed an agreement on the basic principles of the world, and the relationship with the Chechen Republic. In March 1998, the Government announced the resignation of Chernomyrdin, and on the third attempt, under threat of dissolution of the State Duma, held candidacy Sergei Kirienko. After the economic crisis of August 1998 when, two days after Yeltsin\'s emphatic statement on television that the devaluation of the ruble would not be devalued and the ruble was devalued by 4 times, he sacked Kiriyenko government and offered to return Chernomyrdin. August 21, 1998 at a meeting of the State Duma of the majority of MPs (248 out of 450) have called Yeltsin to resign voluntarily, in his support were only 32 deputies. In September 1998, with the consent of the State Duma Boris Yeltsin appointed Yevgeny Primakov to the post of prime minister.In May 1999, the State Duma tried unsuccessfully to raise the issue of impeachment of Yeltsin from office (five charges formulated by the initiators of the impeachment, mainly related to Yeltsin\'s actions during the first term). Before the vote to impeach Yeltsin dismissed Primakov government, and then with the consent of the State Duma appointed Sergei Stepashin, Chairman of the Government, but in August dismissed and submitting for approval of the candidacy of Vladimir Putin, a little-known at the time, and declared him his successor. After the aggravation of the situation in Chechnya, the attack on Dagestan, apartment bombings in Moscow, Buynaksk and Volgodonsk Boris Yeltsin at the suggestion of Vladimir Putin has decided to conduct a series of Chechen counter-terrorist operations. Putin\'s popularity has increased, and at the end of 1999, Yeltsin decided to resign, leaving Putin as acting president.Resignation.On December 31, 1999 at 12 am Moscow time (which was repeated on the main channels for a few minutes before midnight, before the televised New Year) Boris Yeltsin announced his resignation as President of the Russian Federation: Dear friends! My dear! Today is the last time I address you with New Year\'s greetings. But that\'s not all. Today, the last time I address you as the President of Russia. I made the decision. Slowly and painfully pondered over it. Today, the last day of the outgoing century, I am resigning.Yeltsin said that he was leaving not for health reasons, but on the totality of the problems, and apologized to the citizens of Russia.Acting President was appointed Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who immediately after the statement of Boris Yeltsin about his own resignation sent a New Year message to the citizens of Russia.

His territory included the areas around Weilburg, Ottweiler and Lahr in the Black Forest. Like his father, Philip III of Nassau-Weilburg he was an advocate of the Reformation.Life.Albert was the only son of Philip III of Nassau-Weilburg and his second wife Anna of Mansfield. His mother died in childbirth.On 16 June 1559, Albert married Anna of Nassau-Dillenburg, a daughter of the William the Rich of Nassau-Dillenburg and sister of William I of Orange. In the same year, on 4 October 1559, his father, Philip III died. Albert inherited part of the county of Nassau-Weilburg jointly with his younger half-brother, Philip IV. Albert initially ruled jointly with Philip IV. They had inherited a high debt, which hampered their ability to rule. They were however, able to slowly improve their financial position.On 15 May 1561, the brothers split their territory for the first time. Albert was given the castle and district of Weilburg, Philip received castle and district of Neuweilnau. The largest part of the territory and their father\'s debts, however, remained the common property. Albert moved into the new Weilburg Castle, which he continued to expand. In 1571, they split the rest of the territory. Apart from Weilburg, Albert received Gleiberg, Cleen, labor and Burgschwalbach. Albert and Philip concluded several treaties with Hesse, in which they gradually divided their shared possessions.Albert was a member of the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts. He often travelled to the Imperial Diet and to the Emperor Maximilian II as a representative of the Wetterau Association, to discuss freedom of religion for the Calvinist princes. From 1583 to 1588, Albert fought in the Cologne War on the side of the Wetterau Association.When Count John III Nassau-Saarbrcken died in 1574 without a male heir, the Counties of Saarbrcken, Saarwerden and Ottweiler fell to Albert and Philip. They divided them: Philip received Saarbrcken and Saarland; Albert received Ottweiler, the districts Homburg and Kirchheim and the Lordships of Lahr and Mahlberg in the Black Forest. Albert built a new castle in Ottweiler, which became his residence. As the eldest member of the Walram line of the House of Nassau, Albert took up guardianship of John Louis of Nassau-Wiesbaden. As head of the house, he set guidelines for foreign policy.The Saarbrcken inheritance was contested by various sides. Duke Charles of Lorraine claimed the county of Saarwerden. Albert, however, could prevail before the Reichskammergericht. Elector Palatine Frederick III also claimed some of the Nassau territories; Albert was able to settle this issue out of court. Albert and Frederick concluded several treaties, in which the exact rights and boundaries of the various territories were defined. After Frederick III died in 1576, Albert was the executor of his last will and testament.In 1579, Albert extended his influence in Rhenish Hesse by purchasing a share of Jugenheim.Albert died on 11 November 1593 at his castle in Ottweiler. After his death, his three sons jointly ruled his territory. However, two of them died shortly after their father so that the surviving son of Louis II ruled alone from 1602 onwards.Reformation.In his childhood at Neuweilnau Castle, he was educated in the Protestant faith by Kasper Goltwurm. Via Goltwurm, Albert became acquainted with Philipp Melanchthon, with whom he had lively correspondence.Kasper Goltwurm was succeeded in 1560 by Jacob Charsisius, who worked in Nassau-Weilburg as Superintendent until his death. At the request of Charsisius, some Catholic customs, such a celebrating carnival and lighting a bonfire on St. John\'s Eve were made punishable offenses in the Nassau-Weilburg territories. Lorenz Stephani was appointed as superintendent in the areas administered jointly by Hesse and Nassau. He also succeeded as suoerintendent of Weilburg in 1572, and in Ottweiler in 1574. In Ottweiler, Albert and Lorenz Stephani took measures to enforce the Reformation. Catholic priests were converted to the new faith or removed from office; monasteries were dissolved; church property was confiscated; schools were set up and Jus patronatus was purchased.In 1567 and 1568, Albert met his brother-in-law William of Orange several times. Albert supported him in the Dutch War of Independence against the Iron Duke, Fernando lvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. The invasion of the Netherlands in 1568, however failed. Albert vouched for the wages of the mercenaries William had hired.Construction policy.Albert initiated several large construction projects. After the first division of the county, he began converting the castle at Weilburg into a palace. To this end, he commissioned the architect Ludwig Kempf. During this phase, the north wing and the so-called City Piper Tower were added. The alliance coat of arms of Albert and Anna is still attached to the tower. Around this time, he also founded a game park in Weilburg, which still exists.After he inherited Ottweiler, Albert commissioned the architect Christmann Strohmeyer to construct a Renaissance style castle at Ottweiler. This castle was abandoned in 1753 due to disrepair. Albert probably also initiated the expansion of Gleiberg Castle in the late 16th Century, after it had fallen entirely to the House of Nassau.'),(26531881,'George_Richard_Pain','George Richard Pain.George Richard Pain (17931838) was born into a family of English architects.

The captain, Francesco Schettino, ordered evacuation after an hour of drifting, during which the ship had started to list. Meanwhile, the harbour authorities were alerted by worried passengers, and vessels were sent to the rescue. During a six-hour evacuation, most passengers were brought ashore. The search for missing people continued for several months, with all but two being accounted for. The ship was righted on 17 September 2013, and on 24 October 2013 it was reported that DNA analysis of one body found earlier in the same month confirmed it was the body of missing Italian passenger Maria Grazia Trecarichi.Costa Concordia, operated by Costa Crociere (Costa Cruises), is one of the largest ships ever to be abandoned, dominating international media in the days after the disaster. Captain Schettino was arrested on preliminary charges of manslaughter in connection with causing a shipwreck, failing to assist 300 passengers, and failing to be the last to leave the wreck. He was later charged with failing to describe to maritime authorities the scope of the disaster and with abandoning incapacitated passengers. Costa Cruises offered compensation to passengers (to a limit of 11,000 a person) to pay for all damages, including the value of the cruise. One-third of the passengers took this offer. The company also at first offered to pay Captain Schettino\'s legal costs, but later changed its position.There were immediate fears of an ecological disaster, because the partially submerged wreck was in danger of slipping into much deeper water, with a risk of oil pollution that could have devastated the popular tourist zone. In the end, no significant fuel leak occurred, and all the fuel was extracted safely from the ship by 24 March 2012. Costa Concordia has been officially declared a constructive total loss by the insurance company, with her salvage expected to be one of the biggest maritime salvage operations. On 16 September 2013, the parbuckle salvage of the ship began. The operation started late that day due to bad weather, and by the early hours of 17 September 2013 the wreck was set upright on its underwater cradle.In July 2014, the ship was refloated by large caissons (metal tanks) attached to its sides and was towed 320 kilometres (200 miles) to its home port of Genoa. There the ship will be dismantled and materials from the ship will be recycled.On 11 February 2015, after a trial of more than eighteen months, Captain Schettino was found guilty of manslaughter of 32 passengers by the Judge Giovanni Puliatti and sentenced to 16 years in prison. Prosecutors had asked for a 26-year sentence, but the court gave Schettino ten years for multiple manslaughter, five years for causing the shipwreck, one year for abandoning the passengers, and one month for providing false information to port authorities. He is expected to appeal. He would remain free during the lengthy Italian appeal process. No charges were brought against the ship\'s and despite the poor safety culture promulgated by them on board Costa Concordia.Route.Costa Concordia (call sign: IBHD, IMO number: 9320544, MMSI number: 247158500), with 3,206 passengers and 1,023 crew members on board, was sailing off Isola del Giglio on the night of 13 January 2012, having begun a planned seven-day cruise from Civitavecchia to Savona and five other ports. She struck her port side on a reef at 21:42 or 21:45 local time. The reef is charted as an area known as Le Scole, about south of the entrance to the harbour of Giglio Porto, on the island\'s east coast.The initial impact was at a point below water at the Scola piccola, the most seaward exposed rock of Le Scole, which tore a gash in the ship\'s port side below the water line. The impact sheared two long strips of steel from the ship\'s hull; these were later found on the seabed from the main island. The ship has a large boulder embedded in her hull at the aft end of the impact gash. A few minutes after the impact, the head of the engine room warned the captain that the hull had an irreparable tear of through which water entered and submerged the generators and engines.Without propulsive power and on emergency electric power, the ship shifted position only by means of inertia and the rudders and continued north from Le Scole until well past Giglio Porto. Captain Schettino has said various instruments were not functioning. Reports differ whether the ship listed to port soon after the impact and when she began listing to starboard. At 22:10, the vessel turned south. The vessel was then listing to starboard, initially by about 20, coming to rest by 22:44 at Punta del Gabbianara in about 20 metres of water at an angle of heel of about 70. Captain Schettino attributes the final grounding of the ship at Punta del Gabbianara to his own effort to manoeuvre the ship there. In contrast, on 3 February, the chief of the Italian Coast Guard testified that the final grounding of the ship at Punta del Gabbianara may not have been related to any attempts to manoeuvre the ship and the ship may have drifted simply due to the prevailing winds that night.Situation on the bridge.Captain Schettino stated that, before approaching the island, he turned off the alarm system for the ship\'s computer navigation system. I was navigating by sight, because I knew those seabeds well. I had done the move three, four times. He told investigators that he saw waves breaking on the reef and turned abruptly, swinging the side of the hull into the reef. I have to take responsibility for the fact that I made a judgment error. This time I ordered the turn too late. The captain initially stated that the ship was about from the shore (about the length of the vessel) and hit an uncharted rock. However, the ship\'s first officer, Ciro Ambrosio, told investigators that Schettino had left his reading glasses in his cabin and repeatedly asked Ambrosio to check the radar for him.The captain said that Costa Cruises managers told him to perform a sail-past salute on 13 January 2012. Previously, on 14 August 2011, the ship took a similar sail-past route, but not as close to Le Scole. The 14 August 2011 sail-past was approved by Costa Cruises and was done in daylight during an island festival. The normal shipping route passes about offshore.Costa Cruises confirmed that the course taken in 2012 was not a defined [computer programmed] route for passing Giglio. In an interview with the Italian TV channel Canale 5 on 10 July 2012, Schettino stated that this was a contributing factor to the accident. In addition, at the captain\'s invitation, the matre d\'htel of the ship, who is from the island, was on the ship\'s bridge to view the island during the sail-past. A further person on the bridge was a Moldovan dancer, Domnica Cemortan, who testified that she was in a romantic relationship with Captain Schettino and had just boarded the ship as a non-paying passenger.Situation on deck.Passengers were in the dining hall when there was a sudden, loud bang, which a crew member (speaking over the intercom) ascribed to an electrical failure. We told the guests everything was [okay] and under control and we tried to stop them panicking, a cabin steward recalled. Coincidentally, when the ship first made impact with the rock, it was claimed that Titanics theme song My Heart Will Go On was playing in a restaurant. The ship lost cabin electrical power shortly after the initial collision. The boat started shaking. The noisethere was panic, like in a film, dishes crashing to the floor, people running, people falling down the stairs, said a survivor. Those on board said the ship suddenly tilted to the port side. Passengers were later advised to put on their life jackets.Half an hour before the abandon-ship order, one crew member was recorded on video telling passengers at a muster station, We have solved the problems we had and invite everyone to return to their cabins. When the ship later turned around, she began to list approximately 20 to the starboard side, creating problems in launching the lifeboats. The president of Costa Cruises, Gianni Onorato, said normal lifeboat evacuation became almost impossible because the ship listed so quickly.Rescue.After the grounding, passengers and crew were taken ashore from the ship by lifeboats and helicopters or swam to the island, leaving about 40 people missing. Half of these were later found inside the ship, most of them deceased.Evacuation.In the first contact, made at 22:12, between Italian port officials and the Costa Concordia after the impact on the reef, an unidentified officer on board the cruise ship insisted that she was suffering only from an electrical black-out. A passenger\'s video recorded at 22:20 showed panicked passengers in life jackets being told by a crew member that everything is under control and that they should return to their cabins.No lifeboat passenger evacuation drill had taken place for the approximately 600 passengers who had just embarked. A ship\'s cook said that Captain Schettino ordered dinner around 22:30. Around the same time, a patrol boat of the Guardia di Finanza made a call to the Costa Concordia, but no answer came.Captain Schettino participated in three telephone calls with the cruise line\'s crisis management officer. At 22:26, Schettino told the Port of Livorno\'s harbour master that the ship had taken water through an opening in the port side and requested a tug boat. Port authorities were not alerted to the collision until 22:42, about an hour after the impact, and the order to evacuate the ship was not given until 22:50. Some passengers jumped into the water to swim to shore, while others, ready to evacuate the vessel, were delayed by crew members up to 45 minutes, as they resisted immediately lowering the lifeboats. Some sources report that the ship did not list until 23:15 and therefore if Schettino had given the order to abandon ship, the lifeboats could have been launched earlier, allowing the passengers to reach safety. In contrast, one expert stated that a delay might be justified considering the hazards in launching lifeboats while a ship is still moving.Staff or 2nd captain Roberto Bosio, is said to have coordinated some of the deck officers in much of the evacuation. He began to evacuate the ship before Schettino\'s order. Many junior officers and crew members who were aware of the severity of the situation also began readying lifeboats and moving passengers from their cabins before the abandon ship orders were given, a move that has been characterised as a mutiny.While the vast majority of the ship\'s multinational personnel held positions that did not require a seaman\'s qualifications (as they handled services like laundry, cooking, entertainment, cleaning, minding children, and waiting tables), according to a senior shipping official, they had received mandatory training in basic safety to be able to help in situations like this. Although all of them speak at least basic English, most speak no Italian.Several passengers asserted that the crew did not help or were untrained in launching the lifeboats. This allegation was denied by the crew, one of whom stated, The crew members, whether Filipino or Colombians or Indians, tried to the best of our ability to help passengers survive the shipwreck. Comments by some of the passengers that we were unhelpful have hurt us. A third engineer officer from the ship\'s engine room also pointed out that Unlike the captain, we were there until the end. We did all we could to avoid catastrophe. Costa Cruises CEO Pier Luigi Foschi praised the crew and personnel, despite difficulties resulting from the apparent lack of direction from the ship\'s officers and problems in communication.Three people reportedly drowned after jumping overboard, and another seven were critically injured. The local fire chief said his men plucked 100 people from the water and saved around 60 others who were trapped in the boat. Five helicopters from the Italian Coast Guard, Navy and Air Force took turns airlifting survivors still aboard and ferrying them to safety.According to investigators, Captain Schettino left the ship by around 23:30. In one telephone call from the Coast Guard to Schettino, Captain Gregorio Maria De Falco repeatedly ordered Schettino to return to the ship from his lifeboat and take charge of the ongoing passenger evacuation. At one point in the call, De Falco grew so angry at Schettino\'s stalling that he raised his voice and told Schettino, Vada a bordo, cazzo! (translated as Get the fuck [back] on board!, Get [back] on board, for fuck\'s sake! or Get on board, damn it! depending on the source). One of these calls took place at 01:46.At 01:04 an Air Force officer who was lowered onboard by helicopter reported that there were still 100 people on board. Father Raffaele Malena, the ship\'s priest, said he was among the last leaving the ship at around 01:30. The deputy-mayor of Isola del Giglio, Mario Pellegrini, who went on board as part of the rescue operations, praised the ship\'s doctor and a young Costa Concordia officer, the only officer he met on board, for their help. He and the young officer, Simone Canessa, were shoulder to shoulder until 05:30. One of the missing crewmen, a waiter, was last seen helping passengers.At 03:05, 600 passengers were evacuated to the mainland by ferry. At 03:44, the Air Force officer reported that 40 to 50 people were still on board. At 04:46, the evacuation was noted as complete on the Port of Livorno\'s Harbour Master log. The next day, the survivors were transported to Porto Santo Stefano, where the first center for co-ordination and assistance was established. Prime Minister Mario Monti announced his intention to propose to the President of the Republic to grant the gold medal for civil valor to the common people of Isola del Giglio and Monte Argentario for their conduct during the rescue.Search for missing people.Between 14 and 30 January 2012, rescue divers searched within the ship for missing people. The head of the coast guard diving team described the conditions inside the ship, still perched on a ledge, as disastrous. Pitch-black conditions with large furniture drifting around made the rescue operation hazardous. Divers would find a path into the ship and tie down obstacles such as mattresses, before making noise to alert trapped people. The divers worked in pairs for safety and searched each assigned area slowly in a zig-zag manner. The search dives were planned as 40 minutes in duration, with sufficient extra compressed air in the scuba tanks in case of emergency. The divers had two torches positioned on their helmets because underwater visibility varied from approximately 5 to 60cm. In addition, divers marked their route by trailing a line to be used to lead them back out in low visibility and positioned extra emergency air tanks within the ship. The divers were from the Italian Navy, Coast Guard, and Vigili del Fuoco (fire and rescue service).On 14 January, divers searched the ship until nightfall. Divers and firefighters continued to search for survivors who might have been trapped in the ship, and rescued a Korean newlywed couple trapped in a cabin two decks above the water line, and the ship\'s purser, who had a broken leg.On 16 January, violent waters shifted the ship about, interrupting rescue worktrap doors were shut and debris fell on rescuersand giving rise to fear that the ship could be pushed into deep waters or that the fuel could leak. Operations resumed about three hours later. Throughout the process, rescuers set off explosives to create holes in the ship\'s hull to reach previously inaccessible areas. On 18 January, rescue efforts were suspended again when the ship shifted, but shortly afterward were resumed.On 20 January, the ship began shifting by per hour, but on 24 January, Franco Gabrielli, the Italian Civil Protection Agency head, said the ship was stable. The same day divers recovered the body of the 16th victim. On 29 January, the operation was suspended because the ship had shifted in six hours and because of high waves. Gabrielli said, Our first goal was to find people alive... Now we have a single, big goal, and that is that this does not translate into an environmental disaster. By the next day, operations resumed.On 28 January, the 17th body, that of a female crew member, was recovered from a submerged part of the vessel. On 31 January, Italy\'s Civil Protection agency terminated the search in the submerged part of the ship because the deformed hull caused unacceptable safety concerns for divers. On 22 February, guided by information from passengers as to where bodies might be, divers found eight additional bodies in the wreck. A special platform was assembled to facilitate swift recovery of the bodies, four of which were recovered. On 22 February, the recovery was suspended by inclement weather. On 4 March, officials reported that they would use sophisticated robot-like equipment to find the bodies.On 22 March, another five bodies were discovered in a remote section of the ship believed to be inside the hull.On 15 January 2013, the final two bodies were thought to have been located (those of a female passenger and male crew member), but reportedly could not be recovered, as their location near the stern made recovery inaccessible until the ship could be rotated. However, the companies performing the refloating operation denied any bodies had been found.The search for the two still missing continued after the ship was uprighted on 17 September 2013. On 26 September 2013, unidentified remains were found near the central part of the ship, where they were last seen. The remains were to be subjected to DNA testing to determine their identity. On 8 October 2013, the family of missing crew member Russel Rebello was informed that a body believed to be his was found near the third deck at the stern of the ship. Items on the body were reportedly subsequently identified as belonging to missing passenger Maria Grazia Trecarichi instead and on 24 October 2013 it was reported that DNA analysis confirmed it was her body. Additional bone fragments of unknown identity were found in the wreck a few days after the body was found.On 23 October 2013, it was announced that the search for the missing while the wreck was still in the water was completed as far as technically possible. Depending on the outcome of identification analyses of remains already found, further search activities may be conducted in the wreck for the missing crew member Russel Rebello after it has been removed from the water.On 6 and 7 August 2014, divers found human remains on the wreck which was then moored in the port of Genoa. On 3 November 2014, the final body was discovered in the wreckage of the ship.Securing wreck site and protecting environment.Authorities banned all private boats from Giglio Porto and excluded them from a non-navigation zone around the ship.Poor weather conditions could have caused a spill of oil from the ship. A floating oil barrier was put in place as a precaution. High winds on 1 February lifted the protective barrier, allowing into the surrounding waters an oily film that began spreading from the stern of the ship. The protective boom was redesigned for the weather conditions.On 7 February, Civil Protection director Franco Gabrielli told the Italian Senate that the waters were not crystal-clear but are within the legal limits. Environment Minister Corrado Clini told the Parliament of Italy that the amount of diesel fuel and lubricating oil on board Costa Concordia was about the cargo of a small oil tanker. Clini said any oil leakage would be highly toxic for plant and animal life. In a first step to prevent pollution of the shore and assist in a refloat the ship, her oil and fuel tanks were emptied.As part of the recovery effort a group of about 200 giant fan mussels Pinna nobilis were manually relocated to a nearby area due to the threat posed by subsequent engineering work.Isola del Giglio lies within the Pelagos Sanctuary for Mediterranean Marine Mammals, one of the Specially Protected Areas of Mediterranean Importance. It is a popular scuba diving destination, with tourism being its leading industry. Island residents were concerned that the wreck would be an eyesore that turned away tourists, disabling the island\'s economy. One resident explained, Environmental damage is what concerns us most. If the oil pollutes the coast, we\'re ruined. Luigi Alcaro, head of maritime emergencies for Italy\'s Institute for Environmental Protection and Research (ISPRA), an agency of the Ministry of the Environment, stated that in a worst case, [W]e could be talking years and dozens of millions of euros.EMSA-contracted Stand-by Oil Spill Response Vessel Salina Bay arrived at the site of Costa Concordia on 28 January and will remain on station as a precautionary measure during the fuel removal operation. ISPRA\'s Oceanographic Ship Astrea arrived in Tuscany on 29 January to conduct environmental investigations. On 9 February, the CEO of Costa Cruises told residents of Giglio the company would have by mid-March the plan to remove the ship. He also promised to minimise harm to their tourism businesses.The wreck came to rest on a rock ledge and there were concerns that she might slide into deeper water. The stability and deformation of the ship was monitored by satellite imagery and surface-based instruments. Although the ship was not in immediate risk of slipping from its grounded position into deeper water, Environment Minister Clini told the Italian Senate on 8 February that the risk for a collapse is quite real... The more time passes, the weaker the hull becomes. We cannot guarantee that it has not been compromised already. On 29 January 2012, scientists had become very concerned that the ship had moved over six hours that day. On 2 February, the ship shifted during seven hours. Shifts and any high winds and high seas caused suspension of recovery and salvage operations.On 16 February, Civil Protection director Gabrielli confirmed that the data registered is absent of anomalies. Another report based on sonar and laser measurements, and an ISPRA underwater video, indicated that the ship might collapse in its midsection because its weight was not supported between the rock spur supporting the bow and the rock spur supporting the stern, and said at the time that both of those rocks had now started crumbling dramatically. Civil Protection director Gabrielli stated that report was reassuring in that It shows that a part of the seabed has got into the hull, basically increasing the ship\'[s] stability. It was also found that the hull was slowly collapsing under its own weight, making salvage more difficult and expensive.Salvage.All operations planned for the wreck, including defuelling, were conducted jointly by Costa Cruises and the Concordia Emergency Commissioner\'s Office. On 12 February 2012, after weeks of weather delays, Dutch salvage firm Smit Internationale, acting jointly with Italian company NERI SpA, started removing the vessel\'s 2,380 tonnes of heavy fuel oil. The 15 tanks that contained about 84% of the fuel in the vessel were emptied first and expected to take about 28 days. The second phase involved the engine room, which had nearly 350 cubic metres of diesel, fuel and other lubricants. The offloading process required fixing valves to the underwater fuel tanks, one on top, one on the bottom. Hoses were then attached to the valves and as the oil, warmed to make it less viscous, was pumped out of the upper hose and into a nearby ship, replacing it with sea water pumped in through the lower hose to fill the space, so as not to affect the ship\'s balance, a technique known as hot-tapping.By 20 February 2012, the tanks in the forward part of the ship, which had held about two-thirds of the fuel, had been emptied, but the following day defuelling was suspended because of poor weather conditions. On 3 March 2012, salvage workers cut a hole in the ship for access to the engine room, the location of the remaining fuel. On the morning of 12 March, defuelling operations resumed and were completed on 24 March.With defuelling complete, removal of the wreck began. On 3 February, Franco Gabrielli, the head of the Civil Protection Authority, told a meeting of residents of Giglio that the ship would be refloated and removed whole and not cut up for scrap on site. The CEO of Costa stated that after the breaches in the hull were sealed, the ship could be refloated, with difficulty, by giant inflatable buoys and then towed away. The company invited ten firms to bid for the contract to salvage the ship. Six bids were submitted in early March and the proposed removal plans were assessed jointly with the Civil Protection Scientific Committee. The salvage operation was expected to commence in the middle of May. The operation, one of the largest ever ventured, was predicted to take from seven to ten months, depending on weather and sea conditions.By 12 April 2012, Costa Crociere had two consortia in mind: Smit and NERI, or Titan Salvage and Micoperi. On 21 April, it was announced that Florida-based marine salvage and wreck removal company Titan, with its partner company Micoperi, an Italian firm specialising in undersea engineering solutions, had been awarded the contract to refloat and tow Costa Concordia to a port on the Italian mainland. The salvage operation, using the port of Civitavecchia as its base was anticipated to begin in early May, take about 12 months and cost $300 million. Once in port, the ship would be dismantled and the materials sold as scrap. South African freelance Nick Sloane was appointed as salvage master to lead the operation.The parbuckling.Preparatory work consisted of building an underwater metal platform and artificial seabed made of sand and cement on the downhill side of the wreck and welding sponsons to the side of the ship above the surface. Once this was completed, the ship was pulled upright by cables over the course of two days and settled on the platform, a method called parbuckling. Additional sponsons would then be attached to the other side of the ship; both sets would be flushed of water and their buoyancy would refloat the ship to allow her to be towed away, probably for demolition.In June 2012, a barge was put in place, and the removal of her radar, waterslide and funnel began before stabilisation of the ship to prevent further slippage down the sloped seabed. Concordias funnel was cut off in December, and the salvage companies were in the process of building the underwater support structure by mid-January 2013. On 16 September 2013, the parbuckling of the ship began.The operation to right the ship and free her from the rocks began on 16 September 2013, but started late due to bad weather. Once the ship had been rotated slightly past a critical angle of 24 from its resting position, valves on the sponsons were opened to allow seawater to flood into them and the increasing weight of the water in the sponsons completed the rolling of the ship to the upright position at an accelerated pace, without further need of the strand jacks and cables. The ship was returned to a fully upright position in the early hours of 17 September 2013, shortly before 3 a.m. CET. the salvage operation had cost over 600 million ($800 million). The final cost of the salvage came to be $1.2 billion (ref. Nova, Sunken Ship Rescue PBS).Refloating and removal.Following the conclusion of the righting operation, the ship was kept on a platform while further inspections were made and the starboard sponsons attached. On 10 October 2013 a $30 million option was taken with Dockwise for the use of the world\'s largest semi-submersible heavy lift vessel, Dockwise Vanguard, to transport Costa Concordia, as an alternative to conventional towing.In December 2013 invitations were issued by Costa to twelve companies to tender for the dismantling of Costa Concordia, in France, Italy, Norway, Turkey and the UK. On 30 June 2014 the Italian Government endorsed Costa\'s decision to have the vessel dismantled at Genoa by Italian companies Saipem, Mariotti and San Giorgio.On 1 February 2014 a Spanish diver working on the Costa Concordia wreck died after slashing his leg on a sheet of metal. He was brought to the surface alive by a fellow diver, but later died. The name of the deceased has not been released by authorities. This was the only death to occur during the Costa Concordia salvage operation.On 14 July 2014 salvage operators re-floated Costa Concordia off its submerged platform and towed the ship laterally a short distance away from the coast. As of 20 July 2014, the ship had re-floated 7.5 metres from its supporting platform, with 6.3 metres remaining. On 23 July 2014, the Costa Concordia began its final journey to the Port of Genoa.On 27 July 2014, the Costa Concordia arrived in Genoa where it was moored against a wharf that had been specially prepared to receive the vessel for dismantling.On 11 May 2015 Costa Concordia was removed to another location within the Port of Genoa to ease the access of road vehicles which carry the waste from the wreck.Passengers and personnel.By nationality, the passengers included 989 Italians, 569 Germans, 462 French, 177 Spanish, 126129 Americans, 127 Croats, and 108 Russians. The remaining 520 passengers included 74 Austrians, 69 Swiss, 47 Brazilians, 45 Ukrainians, and 42 Dutch; 34 were Koreans, 26 were Hong Kong citizens, 25 British citizens, 21 Australians, 1718 Argentines, 13 Taiwanese, 12 Canadians, 12 Chinese citizens, 12 Poles, 11 Hungarians, 11 Portuguese, 11 Dominicans, 10 Romanians, 10 Colombians, 10 Chileans, 9 Turks, 8 Bulgarians, 8 Peruvians, 6 Belgians, 5 Swedes, 4 Israelis, 4 Danes, 3 Irish, 3 Macedonians, 2 Mexicans, 2 South Africans, 2 Paraguayans, 2 Finns, 1 Indian, 1 Lithuanian and 1 New Zealander.The nationalities of all crew aboard have not been enumerated, but it consisted of citizens of 20 to 40 countries. Some are Italians (including the captain and all the officers), but 202 Indians and 296 Filipinos made up approximately half of the personnel. Other nationalities include 170 Indonesians, 12 British nationals, 6 Brazilians, 3 Russians, and an unspecified number of Colombian, Peruvian, Spanish, Honduran and Chinese. 32 people are known to have died, and 64 others were injured. Three people (two passengers and one crewman) trapped inside the ship were rescued more than 24 hours after the accident. The body of the last missing person, Indian crew member Russel Rebello, was recovered on 3 November 2014.On 27 January 2012, Costa posted on its website the compensation package offered to uninjured passengers. The compensation comprises a payment of 11,000 per person to compensate for all damages (including loss of baggage and property, psychological distress and loss of enjoyment of the cruise) and reimbursement for a range of other costs and losses, including reimbursement for the value of the cruise, for all air and bus travel costs included in the cruise package, for all travel expenses to return home, for all medical expenses arising from the event, and for all expenses incurred on board during the cruise.Costa also promised return of all property stored in cabin safes, to the extent recoverable, and to grant passengers access to a programme for psychological assistance. Costa stated that it would not set off from these payments any amount an insurance policy pays to the passenger. The offer to uninjured passengers was effective until 31 March (year??); as to the families of the dead and missing, separate proposals were to be offered based on their individual circumstances. Costa for a time permitted its customers to cancel without penalty certain future cruises. One-third of the passengers have acquiesced to the 11,000 compensation. The trade union representing the crew has negotiated compensation packages. Crew members will be paid wages for a minimum of two months or, if longer, their full contract term. They are also to receive reimbursement for expenses and up to 2,250 for lost personal property.As well as compensation, survivors of the Concordia disaster have called for safety improvements to be made. From the evidence available, including expert evidence obtained during the criminal proceedings in Italy, it is clear that the initial grounding of Costa Concordia should have been avoided and that subsequent failings in carrying out the evacuation process made a very bad situation far worse.On 23 February 2012, the Environment Ministry announced it would be taking legal action against Costa Cruises regarding a possible claim for possible environmental damage and the cost of salvage.Ship.Industry experts believe the ship is a constructive total loss, with damages of at least US$500 million. Pier Luigi Foschi, CEO of Costa, has told a Senate committee hearing that We believe that the wreck can no longer be put in use. Shares in the Carnival Corporation, the American company that jointly with Carnival plc owns Costa Cruises, initially fell by 18% on 16 January 2012 following a statement by the group that the sinking of the ship could cost Carnival Corporation up to US$95 million (75 million, 62 million). Carnival Corporation later increased the estimated financial impact in fiscal year 2012 to include a reduction in net income of $85 million to $95 million, an estimated insurance excess of an additional $40 million, and $3040 million in other incident related costs.The insurance excess on the vessel was $30 million (23.5 million, 19.5 million). The group of cruise lines jointly owned by Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc comprises 49 percent of the worldwide cruise ship industry and owns 101 ships, of which Costa Concordia represents 1.5% of capacity. Booking volume for Carnival\'s fleet, excluding Costa, in the 12 post-accident days was down by the mid-teens as a percentage of year-earlier bookings.Investigations.The Italian Marine Casualty Investigation Central Board (MCICB Commissione centrale di indagine sui sinistri marittimi, CCISM), a unit of the Corps of the Port Captaincies  Coast Guard, conducts the technical investigations of maritime accidents and incidents within Italian-controlled waters. On 6 February, the International Chamber of Shipping, representing shipowners\' associations, called for the earliest possible publication of the Italian accident investigations. International experts have said that it is too early to speculate on why the vessel capsized despite its watertight compartments but that the size of the vessel is unlikely to have been an issue. Tuscany\'s prosecutor general has said that the investigation will seek to find causes for various aspects of the event, and beyond Captain Schettino to other persons and companies. By January 2013 the technical investigation report had not yet been released. Lloyd\'s List said that the casualty investigation board roundly received criticism for not having released the investigation yet. The board said that the investigation was delayed because the Italian prosecuting team had seized important information, including the voyage recorder.Judge Valeria Montesarchio summoned survivors to testify at a hearing to be convened on 3 March in Grosseto. The European Maritime Safety Agency is the EU agency tasked to develop a common methodology for investigating maritime accidents. The captain tested negative for drug and alcohol use, but one group that is suing Costa Cruises and that leaked the test results, disputed the tests as unreliable. On 24 February 2012, prosecutors alleged that Schettino slowed down the ship so that he could finish dinner in peace and to compensate for lost time, subsequently increased the speed to just before the sail-past.In addition, on 2 February 2012 the prosecutor\'s office in Paris, France, opened a preliminary inquiry to question survivors to establish any criminal liability and assess psychological damage.Criminal proceedings against officers.Captain Schettino (born 1960 in Meta, Naples), who had worked for Costa Cruises for 11 years, and First Officer Ciro Ambrosio were arrested. The captain was detained on suspicion of manslaughter and for violations of the Italian Penal Code and Code of Navigation on three specifications: of his having caused the shipwreck owing to... imprudence, negligence and incompetence resulting in deaths; having abandoned about 300 people unable to fend for themselves; and not having been the last to leave a shipwreck. They were questioned on 14 January.At the validation hearing of 17 January 2012, the Court of Grosseto charged Schettino and Ambrosio with the results from the records of investigation compiled immediately after the event, including the first report of the Coastguard of Porto Santo Stefano of 14 January 2012, the summary testimonial information given by the members of the ship\'s crew, the chronology of events of the Harbour Office of the Port of Livorno, the AIS recording on record, and the PG Annotation of the Harbour Office of the Port of Livorno. Schettino was released from jail on 17 January but was placed under house arrest. The house arrest order included an absolute prohibition against going away or communicating by any means with persons other than his cohabitants. On 7 February, the Court decided to continue Schettino\'s house arrest. On 23 February, two additional charges, of abandoning incapacitated passengers and failing to inform maritime authorities were levied against Captain Schettino. His pretrial hearing was scheduled for 20 March. On 5 July 2012, Schettino was released from house arrest but mandated to reside in Meta di Sorrento.Officials were initially trying to determine why the ship did not issue a mayday and why she was navigating so close to the coast. The delay in the evacuation request was also unexplained.On 11 February, TG5 broadcast a video of the commotion on the bridge following the collision. In the video, when one officer said, Passengers are getting into the life boats, Schettino responded vabbu (a Neapolitan colloquialism which stands for whatever, well or, literally, it is ok). The magistrate in charge of the inquiry remarked, This is new to usI\'ve just seen it for the first time.On 19 February, the Associated Press reported that traces of cocaine had been found on Schettino\'s hair samples but not within the hair strands or in his urinewhich would have indicated he had used the drug. A 2015 report indicated that the ship had been carrying a large amount of mafia-owned cocaine when it sank, although senior officers were likely not aware it was on board.On 22 February 2012, four officers who were on board and three managers of Costa Cruises were placed formally under investigation and face charges of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and failing to communicate with maritime authorities.Recorded evidence.One of the ship\'s voyage data recorders (VDRs), which was designed to float, was recovered. Another containing different data was located on 17 January. A third is in a submerged part of the ship difficult to reach. On 19 January 2012, all the data storage devices from the ship\'s control panel, including hard disks, were recovered. One of the hard disks contained videos from cameras located near the control board, which are expected to reveal the movements of the ship\'s captain and officers. The chief prosecutor received from the Guardia di Finanza a video, taken from their patrol boat, that filmed the ship between 22:30 and 23:10 or at 23:20.On 3 March 2012, in Grosseto, judges began a hearing open to all survivors, other injured parties, and their lawyers but closed to the general public and media. Four specialists were ordered to review the VDR data and relate their conclusions at a 21 July 2012 hearing. Prosecutor Francesco Verusio had stated that it could take a month, two months, three months for evidence analysis, including of recorded conversations on the bridge, to be completed. The hearing also determined who could attach lawsuits to the case. Inhabitants of Giglio and some environmental groups were denied this ability.Trials.On 20 July 2013, five people were found guilty of manslaughter, negligence and shipwreck: Roberto Ferrarini (the company\'s crisis director) received the longest sentence at two years 10 months, followed by Manrico Giampedroni (the cabin service director) at two and a half years. Three crew members  first officer Ciro Ambrosio, helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin and third officer Silvia Coronica  were given sentences between one and two years. Ferrarini, who was not on the ship, was convicted of minimising the extent of the disaster and delaying an adequate response. Giampedroni, the hotel director, was convicted for his role in the evacuation, which was described as chaotic. The helmsman Bin was convicted for steering the ship in the wrong direction after Schettino ordered a corrective manoeuvre. Reuters cited judicial sources as saying none of these individuals are likely to go to jail as sentences less than two years for non-violent offences are routinely suspended in Italy, and longer sentences may be appealed or replaced by community service.Lawyers for the victims decried the sentences as shameful and said they might appeal to overturn the plea bargains that allowed reduced sentences in return for guilty pleas. The company Costa Cruises avoided a trial in April by agreeing to a 1 million fine but victims are pursuing damages in a civil case.In a separate trial for manslaughter and causing the loss of the ship, Captain Francesco Schettino sought a plea bargain agreement. When his trial resumed in October 2013, the Moldavian dancer Domnica Cemortan, 26, admitted being his lover and being on the ship without a ticket, after the prosecution alleged that her presence on the bridge generated confusion and distraction for the captain. The helmsman Jacob Rusli Bin failed to turn up in March 2014 to give evidence and was thought to be somewhere in Indonesia. Roberto Ferrarini told the court in April that Schettino asked me to tell the maritime authorities that the collision was down to a blackout on the ship. But I strongly objected. Passengers told the court in May that if they had followed the officers\' orders to return to their cabins, they would have been drowned. In February 2015, Schettino was convicted and sentenced to 16 years in prison.Costa Cruises and its parent companies.Costa Crociere S.p.A. also does business using the name Costa Cruises. Costa Cruises is jointly owned by a dual-listed company comprising the two separate companies Carnival Corporation and Carnival plc. Carnival Corporation announced on 30 January 2012 that its board of directors will engage outside consultants in various disciplines, including emergency response, organisation, training and implementation, to conduct a comprehensive review of the accident and the company\'s procedures.Costa Cruises at first offered to pay Captain Schettino\'s legal costs but decided later that they would not do so.Regulatory and industry response.Corrado Clini, Italy\'s Minister of Environment, said that saluting, a custom that has resulted in an outcome visible to all, should no longer be tolerated. On 23 January 2012, UNESCO asked Italy to reroute cruise ships to avoid sailing too close to culturally and ecologically important areas, and on 1 March, Italy excluded large ships from sailing closer than two miles from marine parks.The European Maritime Safety Agency was in the process of conducting a review of maritime safety when the accident occurred. On 24 January 2012, Transport Commissioner Siim Kallas told the Transportation Committee of the European Parliament that lessons learned from the loss of Costa Concordia would be taken into account. British MEP Jacqueline Foster warned against trial by television and trial by newspapers, a view that was backed by fellow British MEP Brian Simpson, who said that it was good practice to wait for the official report.On 18 January 2012, the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure announced that it would hold a hearing, conducted jointly with the Committee\'s Maritime Transportation Subcommittee, to review the events of this specific incident, current safety measures and training requirements. Testimony and statements at 29 February hearing primarily promoted North American cruise ships as being safe.Gianni Scerni, the chairman of Registro Italiano Navale (RINA), the classification society that issued Costa Concordia a certificate of seaworthiness and safety management in November 2011, resigned on 18 January 2012.The Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA), the European Cruise Council (ECC) and the Passenger Shipping Association adopted a new policy requiring all embarking passengers to participate in muster drills before departure. On 29 January 2012, at Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Holland America Line made one passenger disembark from the cruise ship for non-compliance during a mandatory muster drill. On 24 April, the CLIA and the ECC introduced new policies: bridge officers must agree on the route before departing; ships must carry more lifejackets; and access to the bridge must be limited.In an action some parliamentarians said was a reaction to the wrecking of Costa Concordia, the Italian government withdrew proposed legislation that would have reduced current restrictions on mineral exploration and production. On 8 July 2012, CNN reported that the disaster brought changes to safety and evacuation procedures in the cruise industry. Carnival, the parent line of Costa, and several other cruise lines now require safety instruction, referred to as muster drills, before leaving port. The new muster policy consists of 12 specific emergency instructions, which include providing information on when and how to don a life jacket, where to muster and what to expect if there is an evacuation of the ship.Media.Coverage of the shipwreck dominated international media in the days after the disaster. The New York Times called the incident a drama that seemed to blend tragedy with elements of farce. Phillip Knightley called it the most significant event in modern maritime history because every single safety procedure designed to make sea travel safe failed miserably.UK\'s Channel 4 television commissioned and broadcast two programmes about the disaster. , broadcast on 31 January 2012, explored how and why the ship went down. The Sinking of the Concordia: Caught on Camera, broadcast on 11 April 2012, provided a minute-by-minute anatomy of the Costa Concordia disaster, made almost entirely from passengers\' mobile phone and video camera footage. The documentary also featured thermal imaging footage of the stricken ship taken by the rescue helicopter, together with pilot commentary, and a recording of the conversation between the Coast Guard and the captain, during which the Coast Guard ordered Captain Schettino to return to his ship.In 2014, the Smithsonian Channel broadcast Cruise Ship Down: Saving Concordia, detailing the efforts to right the Costa Concordia before she collapsed under her own weight.In Italy.Newspaper Corriere della Sera stated that Italy owed the world a convincing explanation for the wreck and called for harsh punishment of those found responsible. Il Giornale said the wreck was a global disaster for Italy. Il Messaggero said there was anguish over those still missing. La Repubblica called the event a night of errors and lies. La Stampa criticised the captain for not raising the alarm and refusing to go back on board the ship.Italian commentators reflected on the contrast between Schettino and De Falco and what it said about the national character. They represented the two souls of Italy, according to Aldo Grasso in Corriere della Sera. On the one hand a man hopelessly lost, a coward who shirks his responsibility as a man and an officer, indelibly stained. The other grasps the seriousness of the situation immediately and tries to remind the first of his obligations.Some saw parallels between the incident and the country\'s recent political upheavals. To see someone that in a moment of difficulty maintains steady nerves is consoling because that is what we need, another Corriere della Sera columnist, Beppe Severgnini, told The New York Times. Italy wants to have steady nerves because we\'ve already done the cabaret route.De Falco\'s exasperated order to Schettino, Vada a bordo, cazzo! became a catchphrase in Italy. T-shirts with the phrase were soon printed and sold across the country. It has also been used on Twitter and Facebook.Honours and memorial.In September 2012, Lloyd\'s of London awarded the title of Seafarers of the Year recognising the best professional sailing and ship to the Costa Concordia crew for their exemplary behaviour during the shipwreck which has saved most of the ship\'s passengers. In January 2013, the municipalities of Isola del Giglio and Monte Argentario have been decorated with the highest Italian Civil award: the Gold Medal of Civil Merit granted by the President of the Republic for the commitment of citizens, administrators and local institutions in the rescue of the survivors of the ship Costa Concordia.The mayor of Giglio, Sergio Ortelli, and Costa Cruises are in agreement that the large boulder to be removed from the side of the vessel should be suitably positioned on the island as a memorial to the 32 people who lost their lives. Ortelli anticipates the boulder will most likely be positioned close to the harbour entrance so that visitors and locals can see it clearly and pay their respects to the victims. What happened that night is something Giglio will never forget and the rock will be a fitting memorial. The cost of removing the 80-tonne boulder is estimated at 40,000.On 13 January 2013, a rock was cast into the sea at the site of the disaster with a plaque to commemorate those lost.Safety regulations.Like all passenger ships, Costa Concordia was subject to two major International Maritime Organization requirements: to perform musters of the passengers (...) within 24 hours after their embarkation and to be able to launch survival craft sufficient for the total number of persons aboard... within a period of 30 minutes from the time the abandon-ship signal is given. Passenger ships must be equipped with lifeboats for 125% of the ship\'s passenger and crew maximum capacity, among which at least 37% of that capacity must consist of hard lifeboats as opposed to inflatable ones. Launching systems must enable the lowering of the lifeboats under 20 of list and 10 of pitch.According to Costa Cruises, its internal regulations require all crew members to complete Basic Safety Training, and to perform a ship evacuation drill every two weeks. Every week, all the lifeboats on one side of the ship are launched for a test. Under the regulations in force in 2006 when Costa Concordia was delivered, the ship had to be designed to survive the flooding of two adjacent compartments caused by an breach. The damage caused by impact with the rocks left a in the hull.Timeline of wrecking.Below is a timeline of the wrecking, 1314 January 2012 (UTC+1).'),(30877704,'2011%E2%80%9312_WHL_season','201112 WHL season.The 201112 WHL season is the 46th season of the Western Hockey League (WHL).

He was drafted by the San Francisco 49ers first overall in the 2005 NFL Draft. He played college football at Utah.In 2004, Smith was named the Mountain West Conference Player of the Year and led the Utes to a Fiesta Bowl victory and a national top-five finish. He played for six different offensive coordinators in his first six seasons in the NFL with San Francisco, and he struggled with injuries and consistency. In 2011, Smith enjoyed his strongest statistical season of his career and led the 49ers to the NFC West division title. In the middle of the 2012 season, Smith sustained a concussion and was replaced by Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick started the remainder of the season\'s games, despite Smith being subsequently medically cleared to play. Following the season, he was traded to Kansas City on March 12, 2013 where he led them to a 90 start and their first playoff berth in 3 years. Since being traded to the Chiefs, he has a 2915 record.Early life.Born in Bremerton, Washington, Smith grew up in La Mesa, California. His father, Douglas D. Smith, was the Executive Director at the high school that Alex attended, Helix Charter High School, until June 30, 2012. As a starter at Helix during his junior and senior years Smith led his team to a record of 251, including two San Diego CIF section championships. He was named to the first-team all-conference and all-county squads in the San Diego CIF system. Smith also earned the conference offensive player of the year twice, and twice won the team MVP for Helix. During his time at Helix, Smith set a school record by throwing for six touchdowns in one game, and recorded the second-highest completion percentage in San Diego CIF history. While at Helix, he played with 2005 Heisman Trophy winner (since vacated) Reggie Bush. Smith and Bush were later finalists for the 2004 Heisman, making it the first time a high school had two finalists at the same ceremony.Smith was president of his senior class in high school, and earned college credits through a program with San Diego State University and having taken a dozen Advanced Placement tests.College career.Smith attended the University of Utah and played for the Utah Utes, wearing number 11. He finished fourth in voting for the 2004 Heisman Trophy and was selected as the 2004 Mountain West Conference Player of the Year. Smith posted a 211 record as a starter in college, while leading a high-powered spread offense under head coach Urban Meyer. He led the Utes to victories in the 2005 Fiesta Bowl and the 2003 Liberty Bowl. Smith earned a bachelor\'s degree in economics in two years with a 3.74 GPA, having matriculated with 64 credit hours earned before attending college, and began work on a master\'s degree in the field before being drafted.NFL Draft.At the NFL combine, Smith recorded a 4.7 time in the 40-yard dash, and had a 32-inch vertical leap. He also earned a score of 40 out of 50 on the Wonderlic exam.The San Francisco 49ers, who held the first overall pick, had hired a head coach with a strong personality in Mike Nolan. Nolan thought Smith to be cerebral, introspective, and non-confrontational. Nolan also evaluated Aaron Rodgers but did not believe that Rodgers\' attitude could co-exist with him. Smith was the first overall pick in the 2005 NFL Draft, selected by the San Francisco 49ers. In July 2005, Smith agreed to a six-year, $49.5 million contract with the 49ers; the contract included $24 million in guaranteed money.2005 season.Dealing with an injury and being taken in and out of the lineup by then-head coach Mike Nolan, Smith played in nine games in his rookie season, recording just one touchdown pass, against the Houston Texans, while throwing 11 interceptions.2006 season.After the challenges faced by his rookie campaign, Smith went into the 2006 season with a new offensive coordinator (Norv Turner) and an improved set of offensive weapons around him. The 49ers used their top draft choice on Vernon Davis, a tight end from Maryland. They also upgraded their offensive backfield, trading underachieving running back Kevan Barlow to the Jets, making Frank Gore the feature back.Smith also spent the off-season working daily with his new coordinator, wide receivers and tight end, while working to improve his technique and add bulk. The improved offensive cast clearly helped Smith develop in his second year, especially early. Smith\'s first three games of the season saw him throw three touchdowns, no interceptions, and amass 814yards. After struggling in Kansas City, he then threw for three touchdowns against the Oakland Raiders, setting a career high. However, the next five games saw Smith resume his growing pains, averaging only 153yards per game while throwing only six touchdowns and nine interceptions. Despite his difficulty, he led the 49ers on a three-game winning streak in November.Smith met Joe Montana for the first time on November 5, 2006, during a game against the Vikings. The 49ers wore the throwback jerseys of the 1989 team which Joe Montana and teammates wore. The 49ers went on to win 93, upsetting the Minnesota Vikings.In need of a statement game, the 49ers traveled to Seattle for a Thursday Night Football game against their division rivals. During the broadcast on NFL Network, Cris Collinsworth noted that if he were starting an NFL franchise, he would have taken the Broncos rookie quarterback Jay Cutler before Alex Smith and fellow rookies Matt Leinart and Vince Young  and that Smith was not even close to the others. Going into the 4th quarter, the 49ers were trailing the Seahawks 73, and pulling out a win looked unlikely. Smith however performed brilliantly in the fourth quarter, and drove the 49ers on a long touchdown drive down the field early, taking a narrow 107 lead. Late in the quarter, with the same score, Smith struck again  shaking off an almost certain sack, rolling to the left and completing a pass to Frank Gore for a touchdown to give the 49ers a 10 point lead. On the next drive, Smith cemented the victory by leading yet another touchdown drive, and rushing for a touchdown on a naked bootleg. Collinsworth had earlier in the game observed that Alex Smith is the best I\'ve ever seen him. That drive is the best I saw, and on seeing his touchdown run, commented What a second-half he has had!After losing to the Cardinals the following week, the 49ers final game of the 2006 season was against a Denver Broncos team looking for a playoff berth. In a major upset, the 49ers defeated the Broncos and knocked them out of the playoffs. During the game at INVESCO Field, Smith threw for 194yards and a touchdown, leading the team to a come from behind victory for the second time in three weeks.Overall, Smith improved in his second year by throwing as many touchdowns as interceptions. He threw for 16 TDs, 16 interceptions, 2,890yards and a 74.8 quarterback rating, all improvements over his rookie year. Alex also became the first 49ers quarterback in club history to take every snap from center over the course of a season in 2006.2007 season.Smith entered the 2007 season learning under a third offensive coordinator in three seasons. Norv Turner was hired as the head coach by the San Diego Chargers. Jim Hostler replaced Turner. Hostler\'s system involved a mixture of the offensive system installed by Turner with elements of the West Coast offense installed by Mike McCarthy for the 2005 season. During the offseason, the 49ers added wide receivers Darrell Jackson, Ashley Lelie, and rookie Jason Hill as new offensive targets for Smith.In the season opener on Monday Night Football against the Arizona Cardinals, Smith led the 49ers to a 2017 win in a two-minute comeback. While down 1713 with less than two-minutes left, Smith drove down the field, highlighted by a 25-yard scramble. After the scramble, he threw a 22yard pass to Arnaz Battle that was fumbled on the one-yard line, but recovered by a 49er so the ball was placed back on the one-yard line with 26 seconds left. The following play Battle ran an end around for the game-winning touchdown. Smith finished the game 15 for 31 with 126yards and two rushes for 37yards.On September 30 in the first quarter of a game against the Seattle Seahawks, Smith injured his right shoulder after getting sacked by Seahawks defensive tackle Rocky Bernard. Smith suffered a grade-three separation and the initial diagnosis was that surgery would not be required. Smith missed the next three games before returning to the 49ers\' starting lineup on Sunday, October 28, 2007.The 49ers did not win a game again until November 25. Among all NFL quarterbacks who qualify for league statistics, only the Jets\' Kellen Clemens had a poorer passer rating than Smith (57.2), Smith completed under 50% of his passes, far below the league average of 60%. Smith was at odds with 49ers head coach Mike Nolan over the severity of his injury. Nolan publicly inferred that Smith was not fighting through the injury, while Smith felt that the injury still affected his ability to throw accurately, an account that was supported by players from the Seahawks. Nolan decided to rest Smith following a loss in that game to the Seahawks on November 12 and start Trent Dilfer to allow Smith\'s shoulder to recover. Following the decision, orthopedic surgeon James Andrews said that upon further examination the shoulder did not heal as significantly as Andrews thought it would, and on December 11, 2007, Smith was placed on injured reserve to undergo surgery on the shoulder, ending his season.2008 season.Smith entered training camp competing for the starting quarterback job with Shaun Hill, who won both of the games he started in 2007, before suffering a back injury against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and journeyman J.T. O\'Sullivan. Smith would be learning under a fourth different offensive coordinator in four seasons; Jim Hostler was fired and replaced by former Detroit Lions offensive coordinator and St. Louis Rams offensive coordinator/head coach Mike Martz. Unlike the previous three seasons, where offensive continuity was somewhat maintained, Martz\'s system was completely different. Smith lost the starting job in training camp to O\'Sullivan, who was elevated to starting quarterback, partly due to his familiarity with Martz\'s offense when he was a member of the Detroit Lions.On September 10, the 49ers placed Smith on injured reserve after Dr. James Andrews confirmed the team\'s diagnosis of a broken bone in his shoulder, believed to have been caused by a wire left in his shoulder from the previous surgery, which had sawed through the bone. Regardless, the 49ers\' general manager, Scot McCloughan, said that the 49ers expected to release Smith before the 2009 season, when they would owe him a salary of $9,625,000.After Nolan was fired on October 20, 2008, the 49ers expressed interest in having Smith remain for the 2009 season if he was willing to renegotiate his contract. On March 10, 2009, the 49ers announced that his contract had been successfully restructured and that he would stay with the team. He took a considerable paycut to remain with the 49ers, with whom he would be under contract for the next two years. Smith was to make $4 million a season in 2009 and 2010, in addition to base salaries that weren\'t immediately made known. In his previous contract, he was scheduled to make $24.6 million in the final two years.2009 season.After the pay cut, Smith said that he was ready to compete for the starting quarterback spot, primarily against Shaun Hill.Mike Singletary became the head coach after a successful term as the interim head coach in 2008, and Martz was fired as offensive coordinator due to the huge differences in offensive philosophies between himself and Singletary. Jimmy Raye II was hired to replace him, marking Smith\'s fifth different offensive coordinator in five seasons. During the offseason, the 49ers drafted Michael Crabtree to be the featured receiver that Smith had been lacking throughout his NFL career. After restructuring his contract with San Francisco, Smith lost the battle for the starting quarterback position to Shaun Hill. However, in a Week 7 game against the Houston Texans, Smith replaced Hill in the third quarter, after Hill had performed poorly and the Niners faced a 210 first half deficit. Smith led the team back with three touchdown passes, all to TE Vernon Davis, but fell short of victory, 2421. Singletary named Smith as the 49ers\' starting quarterback the next day at his weekly press conference on October 26.After his return as the 49ers\' starting quarterback, Smith displayed signs of progress, despite the team\'s 34 record in his first seven starts. He led the 49ers to a Week 12 victory, 203, against the visiting Jacksonville Jaguars, throwing for 232 yards with two touchdown passes while posting a 96.8 passer rating. In a Week 13 match-up against the NFC West division rival Seattle Seahawks, he recorded the first 300-yard passing game of his career, completing 27 of 45 throws with two touchdown passes.2010 season.Smith entered the 2010 season as the starting quarterback. For the first time in his career, he returned under the same offensive coordinator from the previous season, as Raye was retained. However, continuity in a poor system resulted in the team starting 05, and on September 27, Raye was fired and replaced by quarterbacks coach Mike Johnson. Under Johnson, Smith was expected to run a variation of the spread offense that he ran in college. The 49ers continued to build their team having now drafted Anthony Davis and Mike Iupati with their two first round picks to provide more protection. On September 8, Coach Singletary announced that Smith was named one of the team\'s captains.In week 5, Smith was booed at home and the crowd chanted for his backup, David Carr, before leading the 49ers to two scoring drives to close within three points. However, he was hit as he threw on the third drive attempt, resulting in an interception and a 2427 loss, dropping the 49ers to 05. Smith once again suffered an injured shoulder in the 49ers week 7 game against the Carolina Panthers and was not available to play week 8 against the Denver Broncos in London.He was replaced by Troy Smith, who had 14 games of experience in the NFL before joining the 49ers organization just before the start of the regular season. Troy Smith took Smith\'s position after winning 2 straight victories against the St. Louis Rams and the Denver Broncos.However, following a loss to the Green Bay Packers in Week 13 that left the 49ers with a 48 record, Troy Smith was demoted to backup in favor of Alex Smith. The top pick of the 2005 draft would start against Seattle in Week 14 in a game the 49ers needed to win to stay in contention in the NFC West.Smith acknowledged that his performances needed to be more consistent. On December 12, 2010 the 49ers played the Seahawks in San Francisco. Smith was booed by the Candlestick crowd after the first two plays. However, the boos turned to cheers after Smith helped lead the 49ers to a 4021 victory over a division rival. The win moved the 49ers one game behind the division leaders (Rams and Seahawks) with three games left to play. However, the 49ers struggled the following Thursday night against the San Diego Chargers and Troy Smith started the following game against the Rams. Troy Smith struggled in the loss to the Rams and Alex relieved Troy Smith in that game. After the game, Singletary was fired and Alex finished the season starting against the Cardinals. The 49ers finished the season 610 and Smith became a free agent after the season. After his firing, Singletary said, You gotta have a quarterback. Smith had won just 19games in 50career starts through 2010.In 2010, he was chosen as the 11th-smartest athlete in sports by Sporting News.2011 season.The 49ers hired Jim Harbaugh as the new head coach, and Greg Roman replaced Johnson as the new offensive coordinator. Harbaugh, a former quarterback, was the best teacher the 49ers had since Norv Turner in Smith\'s second season. Harbaugh made it known to Smith that he was welcomed back on the team. Smith\'s family wanted him to leave San Francisco. Although he was unsigned, Smith organized the players\' workouts during the 2011 NFL lockout and helped to install Harbaugh\'s new offense. After the lockout ended, Smith signed a one-year $5 million contract with the 49ers. Smith was named the starting quarterback heading into the regular season, and Harbaugh believed Smith could succeed in the coach\'s West Coast offense.During the season, Smith\'s game showed marked improvement, especially in his leadership and intangibles. While he did not put up big numbers like Aaron Rodgers, Drew Brees, Matthew Stafford and Eli Manning did that year, he helped the 49ers win games through efficient play, minimizing mistakes and controlling the clock. In Philadelphia in week 4, Smith rallied the team from a 233 second-half deficit to win 2423, completing 9 of 9 passes for 179 yards and 2 touchdowns in the third quarter alone. Two weeks later Smith led his third come-from-behind road victory of the year with a six-yard fourth and goal touchdown pass to tight end Delanie Walker, beating the Lions in Detroit 2519. In a week 10 matchup against the New York Giants, he completed 19 out of 30 passes for 242 yards. The Giants shut down the 49ers\' run game (Frank Gore was held to zero yards on six carries before leaving the game in the second half) and Smith was instrumental in the 2720 victory.By the time the 2011 season was finished, Smith had helped lead the 49ers to a 133 record in the regular season, including five come-from-behind victories in which four were on the road, and the 49ers earned a first-round bye in the playoffs. After 3 head coaches, 7 offensive coordinators, and 17 different starting wide receivers in the span of 7 seasons with the 49ers, Smith would finally make his first playoff appearance.While the 49ers finished with their most wins since 1997, they did it while ranked 29th of 32 teams in the NFL in total passing yardage for 2011 (including yardage lost from sacks), and Smith was often cynically referred to as a game manager. In this manner, the New York Times wrote that Smith was a steady, if unspectacular, player surrounded by a solid team in 2011, whose career year underscored how much he struggled previously. It was his first season with over 3,000 yards passing, and he set personal single-season highs in virtually every relevant statistical category commonly cited for quarterbacks: in pass attempts with 445, in completions with 273, in completion percentage with 61.3percent, in passing yards with 3,144, in average per pass with 7.1 yards per attempt, in overall passer rating with 90.7, in rushing attempts with 52, in rushing yards with 179, and in total touchdowns scored with 19 (17 passing & 2 rushing), all while being sacked a league-high 44 times. He also threw a league-low 5 interceptions in 2011, breaking a 49ers franchise record, and setting yet another personal single-season best in fewest passes intercepted per attempt with a 1.123percent interception rate, likewise the lowest percentage in the league that year.In the NFC Divisional round of the playoffs, Smith led the 49ers to a win over the New Orleans Saints, with a final score of 3632. Smith threw for 299 yards, three touchdown passes with no interceptions while rushing for an additional touchdown. Smith led touchdown drives of 80 and 85 yards in the final 4:02. He scored on a 28-yard touchdown run, and he threw a game-winning 14-yard touchdown pass to Vernon Davis with nine seconds remaining, eschewing a more conservative open receiver that would have settled for a field goal and a tie. Analyst Ron Jaworski said Alex Smith won the game, not Alex Smith by not making mistakes. His performance won the game for them. Smith also became the first quarterback in NFL playoff history to lead two go-ahead touchdowns in the final 3 minutes of a game. The 49ers lost 2017 in overtime to the New York Giants in the NFC Championship Game. Smith completed 12 of 26passes for 196yards and two touchdowns, but the team turned the ball over twice on special teams. Smith was chosen by teammates as winner of the Ed Block Courage Award, annually awarded to the player that exemplifies a commitment to sportsmanship and courage. Smith made the USA Today All-Joe Team an award which is given to the best players not to make the Pro Bowl.2012 season.Smith became a free agent following the 2011 season. The 49ers were reported to be interested in signing Peyton Manning, who had just been released by the rebuilding Indianapolis Colts, leading Smith to visit the Miami Dolphins, reportedly with the intent to sign with the Dolphins if the 49ers signed Manning. Shortly after Manning made the decision to join the Denver Broncos, Smith signed a three-year contract worth $24 million to remain with the 49ers. During the offseason, the 49ers added wide receivers Randy Moss and Mario Manningham in free agency, and A.J. Jenkins in the first round of the 2012 NFL Draft to improve a passing game that lacked production from the receivers the previous season. Smith began the 2012 season as the 49ers\' starting quarterback. Smith completed 18-of-19 passes for 232 yards and three touchdowns without an interception in a 243 Monday night win over Arizona, and San Francisco was 62 after eight games. In the following game against St. Louis, Smith suffered a concussion in the second quarter, throwing a touchdown with blurred vision before exiting the game. He was replaced by Colin Kaepernick, and the game ended in a 2424 tie.Smith missed the following game, and Kaepernick was 16 for 23 for 243 yards with two touchdowns in a 327 win over Chicago. Harbaugh was impressed with Kaepernick, and said we have two quarterbacks that have a hot hand while dismissing any rule that a player should not lose their starting job due to an injury. A quarterback controversy began. Smith was ranked third in the NFL in passer rating (104.1), led the league in completion percentage (70%), and had been 1951 as a starter under Harbaugh, while Kaepernick was considered more dynamic with his scrambling ability and arm strength. Smith was medically cleared to play the day before the following game, but Harbaugh chose not to rush him back and again started Kaepernick, who threw and ran for a touchdown in a 3121 win over New Orleans. The following week, Harbaugh announced that Kaepernick would start for the 821 49ers, while also stating that the assignment was week-to-week and not necessarily permanent. However, Kaepernick remained the starter as the 49ers again qualified for the playoffs. Harbaugh has stated that Smith had been more of a coach to Kaepernick later into the 2012 season than even he was. Before losing the starting quarterback job, Smith was on pace to set career highs in completion percentage, passing yards, yards-per-attempt, passing touchdowns and rushing yards. Smith was named to the USA Today All Joe Team for the second year in a row, and was also named the captain of the team.2013 season.On February 27, 2013, the 49ers agreed to trade Smith to the Kansas City Chiefs for the Chiefs\' second round pick in the 2013 NFL Draft and a conditional pick in the 2014 NFL Draft. The deal became official at the beginning of the new league year on March 12.After the trade became official, Chiefs head coach Andy Reid stated that Smith will be the starting quarterback for the 2013 season. Smith\'s job as the starter was solidified during OTA\'s (Organized Team Activities, a term usually referring to NFL pre-season activities). According to coaches and teammates, Smith displayed a very high football IQ, and his accuracy in passing was lauded as the best many had ever seen. According to Kansas City\'s quarterbacks coach, Smith is super intelligent and has all of the intangibles that he looks for in a quarterback. The Chiefs were the last unbeaten team in the 2013 NFL season with Smith winning his first nine regular-season starts, gaining 1,919 passing yards with 9 TDs compared to 4 INTs. Smith earned his first and only perfect passer rating on December 15, 2013. He was 17 of 20, with 287 yards and 5 touchdowns, four of them going to Jamaal Charles. Alex Smith and the Chiefs lost to Andrew Luck and the Indianapolis Colts in the AFC Wild-Card Playoff Game on January 4, 2014. Smith threw 4 touchdowns for 378 yards and no interceptions. The final score of the game was 4544 in favor of the Colts.Smith was elected to his first Pro Bowl at the end of the season as a replacement for Tom Brady. In the game, Smith led all QBs in yards, tied for most TDs, and led the game-winning touchdown drive at the end of the game for a 2221 win.2014 season.On August 31, 2014, Smith and the Chiefs agreed to a four-year contract extension. Smith completed 65.3% of his passes in 2014 while throwing for 3,265 yards and 18 touchdowns to only six interceptions. However, the Chiefs finished 9-7 and did not qualify for the playPersonal life.Smith has a brother, Josh, and two sisters, Abbey and MacKenzie. One of Smith\'s great-grandfathers was an Austrian immigrant of Serbian descent who immigrated to the U.S. from the Austro-Hungarian Empire when he was 12 years old. To honor him, Smith, his brother, and his father are each tattooed with four firesteels, the traditional Serbian cross. His sisters have said they will do the same. Smith\'s uncle, John L. Smith, is a college football head coach, and his cousin, Chris Shelton, was a former Major League Baseball player. In 2014, Alex was awarded an honorary degree by his alma mater, the University of Utah, where he also delivered the commencement speech for the graduating class.Smith married former Oakland Raiders cheerleader, Elizabeth Barry, in 2009. In May 2011, the couple had their first child, a son named Hudson. In 2013, they had their second child, Hayes.Charity work.In 2007, Smith started the Alex Smith Foundation and the Alex Smith Guardian Scholars Program, which helps send foster teens to college. He started the program with $500,000, and continues to personally fund the majority of the charity with his own money. The Boston Globe held up Smith\'s foundation as a model charity that properly allocated its funding, noting that it raised $839,244 between 2008 and 2010 and spent 91 percent of the funds on scholarships and grants.'),(41334796,'Military_of_the_Qing_dynasty','Military of the Qing dynasty.The Qing dynasty (16441912) was established by conquest and maintained by armed force. The founding emperors personally organized and led the armies, and the continued cultural and political legitimacy of the dynasty depended on the ability to defend the country from invasion and expand its territory. Therefore, military institutions, leadership, and finance were fundamental to the dynasty\'s initial success and ultimate decay. The early military system centered on the Eight Banners, a hybrid institution that also played social, economic, and political roles. The Banner system was developed on an informal basis as early as 1601, and formally established in 1615 by Jurchen leader Nurhaci (15591626), the retrospectively recognized founder of the Qing. His son Hong Taiji (15921643), who renamed the Jurchens Manchus, created eight Mongol banners to mirror the Manchu ones and eight Han-martial (Hanjun ) banners manned by Chinese who surrendered to the Qing before the full-fledged conquest of China began in 1644. After 1644, the Chinese troops that surrendered to the Qing were integrated into the Green Standard Army, a corps that eventually outnumbered the Banners by three to one.Manchu imperial princes led the Banners in defeating the Ming armies, but after lasting peace was established starting in 1683, both the Banners and the Green Standard Armies started to lose their efficiency. Garrisoned in cities, soldiers had few occasions to drill. The Qing nonetheless used superior armament and logistics to expand deeply into Central Asia, defeat the Dzungar Mongols in 1759, and complete their conquest of Xinjiang. Despite the dynasty\'s pride in the Ten Great Campaigns of the Qianlong Emperor (r. 17351796), the Qing armies became largely ineffective by the end of the 18th century. It took almost ten years and huge financial waste to defeat the badly equipped White Lotus Rebellion (17951804), partly by legitimizing militias led by local Han Chinese elites. The Taiping Rebellion (18501864), a large-scale uprising that started in southern China, marched within miles of Beijing in 1853. The Qing court was forced to let its Han Chinese governors-general, first led by Zeng Guofan, raise regional armies. This new type of army and leadership defeated the rebels but signaled the end of Manchu dominance of the military establishment.The military technology of the European Industrial Revolution made China\'s armament and military training obsolete almost overnight. In 1860 British and French forces in the Second Opium War captured Beijing and sacked the Summer Palace. The shaken court attempted to modernize its military and industrial institutions by buying European technology. This Self-Strengthening Movement established shipyards (notably the Jiangnan Arsenal and the Foochow Arsenal) and bought modern guns and battleships in Europe. The Qing navy became the largest in East Asia. But organization and logistics were inadequate, officer training was deficient, and corruption widespread. The Beiyang Fleet was virtually destroyed and the modernized ground forces defeated in the 1895 First Sino-Japanese War. The Qing created a New Army, but could not prevent the Eight Nation Alliance from invading China to put down the Boxer Uprising in 1900. The revolt of a New Army corps in 1911 led to the fall of the dynasty.The Eight Banners system.One of the keys to Nurhaci\'s successful unification of Jurchen tribes and his challenge to the Ming dynasty in the early seventeenth century was the formation of the Eight Banners, a uniquely Manchu institution that was militarily efficient, but also played economic, social, and political roles. As early as 1601 and possibly a few years earlier, Nurhaci made his soldiers and their families register into permanent companies known as niru, the same name as the smaller hunting parties in which Jurchen men traditionally joined to practice military operations and wage war. Sometime before 1607, these companies were themselves grouped into larger units called gsa, or banners, differentiated by colors: yellow, white, red, and blue. In 1615 a red border was added to each flag (except for the red banner, to which a white border was added) to form a total of eight banners that Jurchen troops carried into battles. The banner system allowed Nurhaci\'s new state to absorb defeated Jurchen tribes simply by adding companies; this integration in turn helped to reorganize Jurchen society beyond petty clan affiliations.As Qing power expanded north of the Great Wall, the Banner system kept expanding too. Soon after defeating the Chahar Mongols with the help of other Mongol tribes in 1635, Nurhachi\'s son and successor Hong Taiji incorporated his new Mongol subjects and allies into the Mongol Eight Banners, which ran parallel to the original Manchu banners. Hong Taiji was more prudent in integrating Chinese troops. In 1629, he first created a Chinese army (Manchu: nikan cooha; Chinese: Hanjun ) of about 3000 men. In 1631 these Chinese troops absorbed men that could build and operate European-style cannon, and were therefore renamed Heavy Troops (M.: ujen cooha; Ch.: zhongjun ). By 1633 they counted about 20 companies and 4,500 men fighting under black standards. These Chinese companies were grouped into two banners in 1637, four in 1639, and finally eight banners in 1642. These Hanjun banners are known as the Chinese or Chinese-martial banners.The banners in their order of precedence were as follows: yellow, bordered yellow, white, red, bordered white, bordered red, blue, and bordered blue. The yellow, bordered yellow, and white banners were collectively known as the Upper Three Banners () and were under the direct command of the emperor. Only Manchus belonging to the Upper Three Banners, and selected Han Chinese who had passed the highest level of martial exams were qualified to serve as the emperor\'s personal bodyguards. The remaining Banners were known as the Lower Five Banners () and were commanded by hereditary Manchu princes descended from Nurhachi\'s immediate family, known informally as the Iron Cap Princes. In Nurhaci\'s era and the early Hong Taiij era, these princes formed the ruling council of the Manchu nation as well as high command of the army.The Green Standard Army.After capturing Beijing in 1644 and as the Qing rapidly gained control of large tracts of former Ming territory, the relatively small Banner armies were further augmented by remnants of Ming forces that surrendered to the Qing. Some of these troops were first accepted into the Chinese-martial banners, but after 1645 they were integrated a new military unit called the Green Standard Army, named after the color of their battle pennants. The Qing created Chinese armies in the regions it conquered. Green Standard armies were created in Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Jiangnan in 1645, in Fujian in 1650, in Lianguang (Guangdong and Guangxi) in 1651, in Guizhou in 1658, and in Yunnan in 1659. They maintained their Ming-era ranks and were led by a mix of Banner and Green Standard officers. These Chinese troops eventually outnumbered Banner troops three to one (about 600,000 Green Standard troops to 200,000 bannermen).Even though the Manchu banners were the most effective fighting force during the Qing conquest of China, most of the fighting was done by Chinese banners and Green Standard troops, especially in southern China where Manchu cavalry could play less of a role. The banners also performed badly during the revolt of the Three Feudatories that erupted in southern China in 1673. It was regular Chinese troops, albeit led by Manchu and Chinese officers, who helped the Qing to defeat their enemies in 1681 and thus consolidate their control over all of China. Green Standard troops also formed the main personnel of the naval forces that defeated the Zheng family kingdom on Taiwan island in 1683.The Banners and Green Standard troops were standing armies, paid for by the central government. In addition, regional governors from provincial down to village level maintained their own irregular local militias for police duties and disaster relief. These militias were usually granted small annual stipends from regional coffers for part-time service obligations.Garrisons in peace time.Banner Armies were broadly divided along ethnic lines, namely Manchu and Mongol. Although it must be pointed out that the ethnic composition of Manchu Banners was far from homogeneous as they included non-Manchu bondservants registered under the household of their Manchu masters. As the war with Ming dynasty progressed and the Han Chinese population under Manchu rule increased, Hong Taiji created a separate branch of Han Banners to draw on this new source of manpower. However these Han bannermen were never regarded by the government as equal to the other two branches due to their relatively late addition to the Manchu cause as well as their Han Chinese ancestry. The nature of their servicemainly as infantry, artillery and sappers, was also alien to the Manchu tradition of fighting almost exclusively as mounted archers. Furthermore, after the conquest the military roles played by Han bannermen were quickly subsumed by the Green Standard Army. The Han Banners ceased to exist altogether after the Yongzheng Emperor\'s banner registration reforms aimed at cutting down imperial expenditures.The socio-military origins of the Banner system meant that population within each branch and their sub-divisions were hereditary and rigid. Only under special circumstances sanctioned by imperial edict were social movements between banners permitted. In contrast, the Green Standard Army was originally intended to be a professional force.After defeating the remnants of the Ming forces, the Manchu Banner Army of approximately 200,000 strong at the time was evenly divided; half was designated the Forbidden Eight Banner Army () and was stationed in Beijing. It served both as the capital\'s garrison and the Qing government\'s main strike force. The remainder of the Banner troops was distributed to guard key cities in China. These were known as the Territorial Eight Banner Army (). The Manchu court, keenly aware its own minority status, reinforced a strict policy of racial segregation between the Manchus and Mongols from Han Chinese for fear of being sinicized by the latter. This policy applied directly to the Banner garrisons, most of which occupied a separate walled zone within the cities they were stationed in. In cities where there were limitation of space such as in Qingzhou, a new fortified town would be purposely erected to house the Banner garrison and their families. Beijing being the imperial seat, the regent Dorgon had the entire Chinese population forcibly relocated to the southern suburbs which became known as the Outer Citadel (). The northern walled city called Inner Citadel () was portioned out to the remaining Manchu Eight Banners, each responsible for guarding a section of the Inner Citadel surrounding the Forbidden City palace complex.The eighteenth century.The policy of posting Banner troops as territorial garrison was not to protect but to inspire awe in the subjugated populace at the expense of their expertise as cavalry. As a result, after a century of peace and lack of field training the Manchu Banner troops had deteriorated greatly in their combat worthiness. Secondly, before the conquest, the Manchu banner was a citizen army, and its members were Manchu farmers and herders obligated to provide military service to the state at times of war. The Qing government\'s decision to turn the banner troops into a professional force whose every welfare and need was met by state coffers brought wealth, and with it corruption, to the rank and file of the Manchu Banners and hastened its decline as a fighting force. Bannermen frequently went into debt as a result of drinking, gambling, and spending time at theaters and brothels, leading to a general ban on theater-going within the Eight Banners.At the same time, a similar decline was occurring in the Green Standard Army. During peace time, soldiering became merely a source of supplementary income. Soldiers and commanders alike neglected training in pursuit of their own economic gains. Corruption was rampant as regional unit commanders submitted pay and supply requisitions based on exaggerated head counts to the quartermaster department and pocketed the difference. When Green Standard troops proved unable to fire their guns accurately while suppressing a rebellion of White Lotus followers under Wang Lun in 1774, the governor-general blamed the failure on enemy magic, prompting a furious reply from the Qianlong Emperor in which he described incompetence with firearms as a common and pervasive disease of the Green Standard Army, whose gunners were full of excuses.Qing emperors attempted to reverse the decline of the military through a variety of means. Although it was under the Qianlong Emperor that the empire expanded to its greatest extent, the emperor and his officers frequently made note of the decline of martial discipline among the troops. Qianlong reinstituted the annual hunt at Mulan as a form of military training. Thousands of troops participated in these massive exercises, selected from among Eight Banners troops of both the capital and the garrisons. Qianlong also promoted military culture, directing his court painters to produce a large number of works on military themes, including victories in battle, the grand inspections of the army, and the imperial hunt at Mulan.Qing armies in the eighteenth century may not have been as well-armed as their European counterparts, but under pressure from the imperial throne they proved capable of innovation and efficiency, sometimes in difficult circumstances. In the Second Jinchuan War, for instance, the Qianlong emperor despatched the Jesuit Felix da Rocha, the director of the Bureau of Astronomy, to the front to cast heavy field cannon that could not be transported to the deep mountains in which the Jinchuan tribes lived.When the Taiping Rebellion broke out in the 1850s, the Qing court found out belatedly that the Banner and Green Standards troops could neither put down internal rebellions nor keep foreign invaders at bay.Transition and modernization.Early during the Taiping Rebellion, Qing forces suffered a series of disastrous defeats culminating in the loss of the regional capital city of Nanjing in 1853. The rebels massacred the entire Manchu garrison and their families in the city and made it their capital. Shortly thereafter, a Taiping expeditionary force penetrated as far north as the suburbs of Tianjin in what was considered the imperial heartlands. In desperation the Qing court ordered a Chinese mandarin, Zeng Guofan, to organize regional () and village () militias into a standing army called tuanlian to contain the rebellion. Zeng Guofan\'s strategy was to rely on local gentries to raise a new type of military organization from those provinces that the Taiping rebels directly threatened. This new force became known as the Xiang Army, named after the Hunan region where it was raised. The Xiang Army was a hybrid of local militia and a standing army. It was given professional training, but was paid for out of regional coffers and funds its commanders  mostly members of the Chinese gentry  could muster. The Xiang Army and its successor, the Huai Army, created by Zeng Guofan\'s colleague and student Li Hongzhang, were collectively called the Yong Ying (Brave Camp).Before forming and commanding the Xiang Army, Zeng Guofan had no military experience. Being a classically educated Mandarin, his blueprint for the Xiang Army was taken from a historical source  the Ming general Qi Jiguang, who, because of the weakness of regular Ming troops, had decided to form his own private army to repel raiding Japanese pirates in the mid-16th century. Qi Jiguang\'s doctrine was based on Neo-Confucian ideas of binding troops\' loyalty to their immediate superiors and also to the regions in which they were raised. This initially gave the troops an excellent esprit de corps. Qi Jiguang\'s army was an ad hoc solution to the specific problem of combating pirates, as was Zeng Guofan\'s original intention for the Xiang Army, which was raise to eradicate the Taiping rebels. However, circumstances led to the Yongying system becoming a permanent institution within the Qing military, which in the long run created problems of its own for the beleaguered central government.First, the Yongying system signaled the end of Manchu dominance in Qing military establishment. Although the Banners and Green Standard armies lingered on as parasites depleting resources, henceforth the Yongying corps became the Qing government\'s de facto first-line troops. Secondly the Yongying corps were financed through provincial coffers and were led by regional commanders. This devolution of power weakened the central government\'s grip on the whole country, a weakness further aggravated by foreign powers vying to carve up autonomous colonial territories in different parts of the Qing Empire in the later half of the 19th century. Despite these serious negative effects, the measure was deemed necessary as tax revenue from provinces occupied and threatened by rebels had ceased to reach the cash-strapped central government. Finally, the nature of Yongying command structure fostered nepotism and cronyism amongst its commanders, whom, as they ascended the bureaucratic ranks laid the seeds to Qing\'s eventual demise and the outbreak of regional warlordism in China during the first half of the 20th century.By the late 19th century, China was fast descending into a semi-colonial state. Even the most conservative elements within the Qing court could no longer ignore China\'s military weakness in contrast to the foreign barbarians literally beating down its gates. In 1860, during the Second Opium War, the capital Beijing was captured and the Summer Palace sacked by a relatively small Anglo-French coalition force numbering 25,000.Self-Strengthening and military modernization.Although the Chinese invented gunpowder, and firearms had been in continual use in Chinese warfare since as far back as the Song dynasty, the advent of modern weaponry resulting from the European Industrial Revolution had rendered China\'s traditionally trained and equipped army and navy obsolete.After the humiliating capture of Beijing and the sack of the Summer Palace in 1860, officials like Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang, and the Manchu Wenxiang made efforts to acquire advanced western weapons and copy western military organization. Special brigades of Chinese soldiers equipped with modern rifles and commanded by foreign officers (one example is the Ever Victorious Army commanded by Frederick Townsend Ward and later Charles George Gordon) helped Zeng and Li to defeat the Taiping rebels. Li Hongzhang\'s Huai Army also acquired western rifles and incorporated some western drills. Meanwhile, in Beijing, Prince Gong and Wenxiang created an elite army, the Peking Field Force, which was armed with Russian rifles and French cannon and drilled by British officers. When this force of 2,500 bannermen defeated a bandit army more than ten times more numerous, they seemed to prove Wenxiang\'s point that a small but well-trained and well-equipped banner army would be sufficient to defend the capital in the future.One major emphasis of the reforms was to improve the weaponry of Chinese armies. In order to produce modern rifles, artillery, and ammunition, Zeng Guofan created an arsenal in Suzhou, which was moved to Shanghai and expanded into the Jiangnan Arsenal. In 1866 the sophisticated Fuzhou Shipyard was created under the leadership of Zuo Zongtang, its focus being the building of modern warships for coastal defense. From 1867 to 1874 it built fifteen new ships. Other arsenals were created in Nanjing, Tianjin (it served as a major source of ammunition for northern Chinese armies in the 1870s and 1880s), Lanzhou (to support Zuo Zongtang\'s quelling of a large Muslim uprising in the northwest), Sichuan, and Shandong. Prosper Giquel, a French naval officer who served as adviser at the Fuzhou Shipyard, wrote in 1872 that China was quickly becoming a formidable rival to western powers.Thanks to these reforms and improvements, the Qing government gained a major advantage over domestic rebels. After vanquishing the Taiping in 1864, the newly equipped armies defeated the Nian Rebellion in 1868, the Guizhou Miao in 1873, the Panthay Rebellion in Yunnan in 1873, and in 1877 the massive Muslim uprising that had engulfed Xinjiang since 1862. In addition to quelling domestic revolts, the Qing also fought foreign powers with relative success. Qing armies managed to solve the 1874 crisis with Japan over Taiwan diplomatically, forced the Russians out of the Ili River valley in 1881, and fought the French to a standstill in the Sino-French War of 18841885 despite many failures in naval warfare.The military improvements that resulted from modernizing reforms were substantial, but they still proved insufficient, as the Qing was soundly defeated by Meiji Japan in the Sino-Japanese War of 18941895. Even China\'s best troops  the Huai Army and the Beiyang Fleet, both commanded by Li Hongzhang  were no match for Japan\'s better-trained, better led, and faster army and navy.The surprising defeat and the humiliating settlement that followed made the previous reforms seem like utter failures. For a long time, western and Chinese scholars attributed the failure of military modernization to Chinese or Manchu ethnocentrism and to the incompatibility of the Confucian world-order with the demands of modernity. More concrete reasons were lack of funding (especially after 1875, when funds gained from new taxes and tariffs had been diverted to other uses), a general reluctance to adopt western training techniques, and over-reliance on individual leaders like Wenxiang or Li Hongzhang.The government attempts to modernize during the Self-Strengthening Movement were, in the view of most historians with hindsight, piecemeal and yielded few lasting results. The various reasons for the apparent failure of late-Qing modernization attempts that have been advanced including the lack of funds, lack of political will, and unwillingness to depart from tradition. These reasons remain disputed.The New Armies.Losing the First Sino-Japanese War of 18941895 was a watershed for the Qing government. Japan, a country long regarded by the Chinese as little more than an upstart nation of pirates, had convincingly beaten its larger neighbour and in the process annihilated the Qing government\'s pride and joy  its modernized Beiyang Fleet, then deemed to be the strongest naval force in Asia. In doing so, Japan became the first Asian country to join the previously exclusively western ranks of colonial powers. The defeat was a rude awakening to the Qing court especially when set in the context that it occurred a mere three decades after the Meiji Restoration set a feudal Japan on course to emulate the Western nations in their economic and technological achievements. Finally, in December 1894, the Qing government took concrete steps to reform military institutions and to re-train selected units in westernized drills, tactics and weaponry. These units were collectively called the New Army. The most successful of these was the Beiyang Army under the overall supervision and control of a former Huai Army commander, General Yuan Shikai, who used his position to eventually become President of the Republic of China and finally emperor of China.The military leaders and the armies formed in the late 19th century continued to dominate politics well into the 20th century. During what was called the Warlord Era (19161928) the late-Qing armies became rivals and fought among themselves and with new militarists.See also.Chu ArmyFujian FleetGansu BravesGapsin CoupGreat Hsi-Ku ArsenalGuangdong FleetImo IncidentImperial Guards BrigadeJiangnan DayingNanyang FleetNine Gates Infantry CommanderSecond rout of the Jiangnan DayingWuwei Troop'),(41007183,'Thigh_gap','Thigh gap.A thigh gap is a space between the inner thighs of some women when standing upright with knees touching. A thigh gap has become an aspect of physical attractiveness that has been associated with fragility and femininity. In the United States, it has been reported that among teenage girls, a gap has become a beauty ideal. Achieving a thigh gap is difficult for many women and has led to cases of extreme dieting or even surgery in order to try to obtain it. The thigh gap craze has been criticized as physically unnatural and a mostly unachievable body shape goal and as a cause of eating disorders.Origins of the phenomenon.The idea of the thigh gap received widespread news coverage in December 2012 after the Victoria\'s Secret Fashion Show which featured several models with thin thighs. As a result, hundreds of blogs, Twitter accounts and Internet memes were published, and images of thigh gaps featured in thinspiration blogs and across social networking sites. The Twitter account Cara\'s Thigh Gap was started which used images of Cara Delevingne as an example of thigh gaps.In 2013, author Camille Hugh published her book The Thigh Gap Hack: The Shortcut to Slimmer, Feminine Thighs Every Woman Secretly Desires, and in June 2013 she was interviewed about the book on The Dr. Oz Show. The book was criticized by Lisa Delaney of Spryliving.com, who said the bottom line is that the Thigh Gap Hack feeds girls\' and women\'s obsessions with their bodies, promotes thinness at the expense of healthfulness (because of Hugh\'s disdain of fitness, exercise, muscles, etc.), and promotes flaky, unproven methods for weight/fat loss.Backlash.A backlash quickly developed amongst those concerned about the potential negative consequences of the trend. Parenting experts and counselors formed anti-thigh gap movements including the Tumblr sites Touching Thighs and No Thigh Gap. The medical community and female-empowerment advocates have also commented critically on the subject, and the U.S. National Eating Disorders Association launched a website to promote healthy body image and attitudes to food and weight.Australian plus-size model Robyn Lawley criticized the thigh gap trend, denouncing it as just another tool of manipulation that other people are trying to use to keep me from loving my body. Target Corporation apologized after Cassey Ho discovered that a photo of a model had a photoshopped thigh gap for a girl\'s bathing suit ad. Old Navy came under criticism by bloggers after a photo of a mannequin wearing women\'s plus-size jeans on their website appeared to have a small thigh gap placed so that the jeans on the mannequin would look thinner than they would look on an actual person. Old Navy subsequently stated on their website that they do not use any photo-altering techniques to deliberately alter how their products appear to fit.Media comment.The thigh gap has also spawned opinions from newspapers. The Times of India called it mania. Columnist Kelly Richardson of the Sacramento Bee wrote that for most people it is next to impossible to attain. In The Observer journalist Rosie Swash called the thigh gap widespread, harmful and often unachievable. Columnist Hadley Freeman called it the most extreme body fixation yet.Geneticist Sylvia Pagn Westphal was inspired to write an opinion piece on the thigh gap after her daughter brought the trend to her attention and was appalled by the results of her Google search for the term. San Jose State University sociologist Natalie Boero has attributed the trend to living in a sexist and sizeist culture and clinical psychologist Barbara Greenberg has dismissed the trend as a pipe dream, adding most women are not built that way to have that space between their thighs.'),(30679120,'Hirschsprung%2C_Germany','Hirschsprung, Germany.Hirschsprung is a village in the eastern Ore Mountains in Saxony, Germany.

Despite its name, the station is not actually located in Ozone Park, but rather in the adjacent neighborhood of Richmond Hill.History.Lefferts Boulevard is one of six stations along Liberty Avenue in Queens that were originally constructed as part of the BMT\'s portion of the Dual Contracts. The stations from 80th Street  Hudson Street to Lefferts Boulevard opened on September 25, 1915 as an extension of the Fulton Street Elevated Line. The connection to the BMT was severed on April 26, 1956, with a new connection to the IND Fulton Street Line opening on April 29, 1956. The Fulton Street Elevated west of Hudson Street was closed, and eventually demolished.The station has gone by a number of different names. It opened as Lefferts Avenue. A 1924 system map portrayed the station as Lefferts Avenue, with 119th St. shown below the name in parentheses, and in a smaller print. By 1948, Lefferts and 119 were shown in equal sizes, and by 1959 the name was shown as 119 StLefferts. Lefferts Avenue was later renamed Lefferts Boulevard, and the station appears as Ozone Park  Lefferts Boulevard on the current official map.In 2014, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority started a renovation project at the Lefferts Boulevard station.

She then became a pupil teacher and, in 1909, qualified as an infant school teacher.Smith joined the Social Democratic Federation (SDF) in about 1910 and, the following year, attended a course on political science run by the Workers Educational Association (WEA). She was offered a place at Lady Margaret Hall to train as a WEA lecturer, but rejected it, as she was concerned that the WEA would restrict her from expressing her Marxist views. However, she did attend WEA summer schools at Balliol College in Oxford. She remained a member of the SDF it later became the British Socialist Party. In 1916, she married Alfred Smith, and was thereby compelled to leave her teaching job. Instead, during World War I, she worked in a munitions factory, where she became the leading trade unionist and, later, a full-time union official.Activism in Mansfield.Around this time, Smith moved to Mansfield in nearby Nottinghamshire, where she joined the Socialist Labour Party. In 1922, the entire branch joined the new Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), although as she was married and had young twin children, the CPGB decided to place her on a special probationary membership. Despite this, Smith became a highly active member, the secretary of the Mansfield Labour College, a delegate to Mansfield Trades Council, and a prominent member of the National Minority Movement.In 1928, Smith became the CPGB\'s National Women\'s Officer, and the following year, she became a full-time organiser for the CPGB. She stood as the party\'s candidate in Mansfield at the 1929 UK general election, taking only 533 votes. Smith and her husband had drifted apart, and the two separated in 1930; she moved with the children to Burnley in Lancashire, hoping to organise women involved in local textile work to join the Minority Movement. She was selected to stand for the party in the Burnley constituency at the 1931 UK general election, but was arrested after supporting pickets during a strike and sentenced to three months in prison.Later career in England.On her release, Smith relocated to nearby Bolton, where she stood in the 1932 council election. In that year, she led the Women\'s Hunger March, and was elected to the CPGB\'s Central Committee, serving until 1938. Although generally loyal to the party line, she opposed the dissolution of the National Minority Movement, and lobbied for the party to support birth control.From 1942 until 1955, Smith worked as a journalist with the Daily Worker; she then retired to Chesterfield and devoted the remainder of the decade to the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. By 1960, she had become bored with this, and decided to move to Australia to live with her son, but she felt she was a burden there. She spoke with Ted Hill and decided to take up a post in China, working for the Foreign Languages Press. After speaking with Zhou Enlai, she decided to support Maoism following the Sino-Soviet split; this led her to lose contact with many former friends in the CPGB.China.Smith later worked on China Reconstructs and then at the Xinhua News Agency.

The design is aimed at minimizing users\' development time, with execution speed a secondary goal. Users specify neuron models by giving their differential equations in standard mathematical form, create groups of neurons and connect them via synapses. The intent is to make the process as flexible as possible, so that researchers are not restricted to using neuron models already built into the simulator. The entire simulator is written in Python, using the NumPy and SciPy numerical and scientific computing packages. Parts of the simulator can optionally be run using C code generated on the fly. Computationally, Brian uses vectorization techniques, so that for large numbers of neurons, execution speed is of the same order of magnitude as C code.Version 2 of Brian (currently in development) is based around the concept of code generation: users specify the model in Python but behind the scenes Brian generates, compiles and runs code in one of several languages (including Python, Cython and C++). This enables better performance than Brian 1, and additionally allows the new standalone mode in which Brian generates an entire C++ source code tree with no dependency on Brian. This allows Brian to be run on platforms where Python is not available (for example, on a robot). The code generation mechanism is extensible, and there are now projects underway to generate code to run on GPGPU and Android.Example.The following code defines, runs and plots a randomly connected network of leaky integrate and fire neurons with exponential inhibitory and excitatory currents.P = NeuronGroup(4000, eqs, threshold=-50*mV, reset=-60*mV)Ce = Connection(Pe, P, \'ge\', weight=1.62*mV, sparseness=0.02)Ci = Connection(Pi, P, \'gi\', weight=-9*mV, sparseness=0.02)raster_plot(M)Comparison to other simulators.Brian is primarily aimed at single compartmental model neurons. Simulators focused on multi-compartmental models include Neuron, GENESIS, and its derivatives.Another similar simulator is NEST.'),(9656423,'Maxxie_Oliver','Maxxie Oliver.Maxxie Oliver is a fictional character in the British television series Skins. He is portrayed by actor Mitch Hewer.Characterisation.Maxxie is portrayed as proficient at several styles of dance, including tap dance. He is also shown as being a brilliant artist, seductive, well-liked and well-adjusted. He is hinted to having many promiscuous relationships throughout the series. He is somewhat of a comedian, particularly with best friends Anwar Kharral and Chris Miles. According to a Myspace-style about me section on the Skins website, he describes his favorite things as toast, boys, dancing, drawing, Arcade Fire and the Sistine Chapel, and he wants to meet Johnny Depp, Nigel Reo-Coker and Ron from Harry Potter.Like Anwar, Maxxie does not have an episode name to himself, instead being the centric character in Maxxie & Anwar and Tony & Maxxie, although the episode Sketch greatly involves him, as it is about his stalker.Series 1.In Tony, he convinces Anwar and Chris to join him on a big gay night out, but eventually goes to Abigail Stock\'s party after the night out wasn\'t what was expected.In Maxxie and Anwar, on a school trip to Russia, Maxxie and his best mate Anwar face issues regarding their status as best friends, with Anwar\'s faith condemning homosexuality. Maxxie indicates he views Anwar as homophobic and hypocritical - as a Muslim, Anwar dislikes gay people but at the same time has pre-marital sex, takes drugs and drinks alcohol. Eventually, Maxxie tries one more time to get Anwar to accept him, but Anwar reluctantly refuses, ending their friendship. Maxxie walks away with tears in his eyes. Tony Stonem tries repeatedly to seduce Maxie to \'try something new\' which Maxxie refuses because of Tony\'s girlfriend Michelle Richardson. After his fight with Anwar, he gets very drunk and in his distraught state gives into temptation with Tony for means of comfort - and informs Tony that he wasn\'t good. Unknown to them, Michelle has witnessed the entire thing.In Michelle, Tony is seen continuing to flirt with Maxxie, and Michelle subsequently dumps Tony. Maxxie is quick to apologise to Michelle for the incident in Russia, and he is upset when she derides him as a dirty little slut who fucks around with other people\'s boyfriends. Later, racked with guilt over his friends\' breakup, Maxxie states in his psychology lesson that it was his fault that Tony ended up giving him head, to quote \'I lost my head and then he [Tony] gave me head\', despite the fact that everything that happened had been pushed for and orchestrated by Tony.In the series 1 finale, Maxxie calls Anwar to wish him a happy birthday, however, he refuses to attend his party until Anwar tells his parents that Maxxie is gay. Anwar, desperate to see Maxxie, eventually finds him waiting outside, still refusing to go inside. Mr. Kharral eventually arrives outside, spotting Maxxie and the two talk until Anwar tells his father that Maxxie is gay. Mr. Kharral seemingly ignores Anwar until Maxxie restates it himself. Mr. Kharral then explains that there are a lot of things in the world he doesn\'t understand - particularly homosexuality - but that his faith in Allah means he believes God one day will reveal to him all he does not understand and until then, will treat Maxxie no differently. With that, Maxxie and Anwar\'s friendship is renewed. Maxxie and Anwar also back up Chris in the brawl later that night and in the end Maxxie happily ends up in an embrace with one of Chris\' attackers who has seemingly fallen for him.Series 2.The series two premiere episode, which is focused on Tony, introduces Maxxie\'s parents: Jackie (Fiona Allen) and Walter Oliver (Bill Bailey), revealing Maxxie\'s surname, that he has a dog called Taz and the situation with his parents. After Tony\'s accident in series one and his subsequent brain trauma, Maxxie, Jal Fazer and Chris are the only friends who are still there for him. His mother, who used to work as Tony\'s nanny, is taking on that role again. Like Maxxie, his father and even his dog dance in their spare time, although Maxxie struggles to convince his dad to let him drop his A Levels and audition for musicals in London. Though Maxxie generally comes from a stable home with loving parents, he remains subject to homophobic abuse from chavs on the council estate where he lives. It later turns out that one of the chavs  Dale  is in fact gay after tackling Maxxie to the ground and kissing him at a later opportunity. Maxxie resists at first but eventually gives in and they end up sleeping together. When Maxxie returns home the next morning, he sees a distraught Tony and comforts him. Eventually in the episode, after Walter has had much time to reflect on his relationship with his son, they agree that he will at least continue his A Levels, even if he does not join his father as a builder afterwards as Walter would prefer.In Sketch, Maxxie is stalked by Sketch, a young Welsh student who cares for her ailing mother in the flat opposite Maxxie\'s. Sketch takes pictures of Maxxie and pins them up on a board of her room, leaves Maxxie several gifts in his locker, leaving him to wonder who they\'re from, makes herself appear more masculine (such as wearing male clothing and flattening her chest with a sash) to appear attractive to him, and watches him practice a performance with Michelle in a musical.Following this, in the Unseen Skins episode A Cycological Romance, Monday: Maxxie meets a new love interest: James (played by Sean Verey), who is also gay and a cyclist. Maxxie seems very interested, leaving him a note on his bicycle. Sketch steals this note, later slashing Maxxie\'s tires. Tuesday: Maxxie is forced to take the bus, and so leaving a window for Sketch to approach James warning him off on the grounds that she was his ex-girlfriend and he stalks her (both lies). Wednesday: James tells Maxxie to leave him alone, only to work out Sketch was lying. The next morning (Thursday), James finds his tires slashed and is also forced to get the bus, meeting Maxxie on board. They talk and work out that this is all Sketch\'s work; they decide to start again. Sketch is seen outside looking in with a face of melancholy, as the two exchange names. In the television episode Jal, Maxxie proudly introduces James to everyone at college. Sketch seems to look jealous at the pairing whilst Anwar looks uneasy.In his last episode, Maxxie and James move to London together, also being joined by Anwar, who abandons Sketch at the bus stop.U.S. adaption.Maxxie was the only character from the original UK version who didn\'t appear in the American adaptation. He was replaced by Tea Marvelli, a self-proclaimed lesbian.'),(17045608,'Our_American_Cousin_(opera)','Our American Cousin (opera).Our American Cousin is an opera in three acts by American composer Eric Sawyer with libretto by poet John Shoptaw. The main plot depicts the assassination of Abraham Lincoln from the standpoint of the actors presenting Tom Taylor\'s play of the same name at Ford\'s Theatre in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1865. It aims to offer something new in the realm of American contemporary opera, an American myth told in an unfamiliar way, with both poetic and musical language drawing from the past but refracted through the present.The opera\'s narrative is the collaborative invention of Shoptaw and Sawyer, freely imagined within the framework of the documented historical event and adapted plot of the original comedy. Its three acts comprise the backstage events prior to the play, the play itself, and the rupture of the stage drama by the assassination and its aftermath.Performance history.The world premiere of the fully staged opera occurred on June 20, 2008 in Northampton, Massachusetts at the Academy of Music Theater, the city\'s 800-seat 1892 opera house, one of the oldest municipally-owned theaters in the nation and not unlike Ford\'s Theatre. The performance featured the Boston Modern Orchestra Project conducted by Gil Rose. Principal performers included Janna Baty as Laura Keene, Drew Poling as Ned Emerson, Alan Schneider as Harry Hawk, Aaron Engebreth as Jack Matthews, and Tom O\'Toole as John Wilkes Booth. Stage direction was by Carole Charnow, general director of Opera Boston.The opera had been previously performed in a concert version on March 31, 2007 at Amherst College in Amherst, Massachusetts, with the same principals as above along with the Amherst College Concert Choir.Recording.A recording of the opera was released in 2008 on the BMOP/Sound label by the Boston Modern Orchestra Project. In a review of the CD Robert Carl noted ...this is one of the freshest, most ambitious new American operas I\'ve heard in ages. Instead of taking up once again some cinematic or literary retread, it actually dares to use original material. And it also dares to take up historical events and musical tropes without succumbing to mere costume drama I appreciate, admire, and enjoy Sawyer\'s voice. And I hope this is only the first of Shoptaw\'s librettos. As a first collaboration, the result is stunning.Synopsis.As the cast of the comic play Our American Cousin assembles backstage, aging actor Ned Emerson spins out a comparison of theater to war, while leading man Harry Hawk broods over a letter informing him of the death of a friend he hired to be his substitute in battle. Character villain Jack Matthews banters with John Wilkes Booth, who appears backstage to present him with a sealed letter announcing news that has not come to pass. Knowing Booth has concocted violent and subversive scenes in the past, an alarmed Matthews hides the letter in his pocket. As they arrive, groups of theatergoers give voice to their thoughts, while backstage a last-minute rehearsal erupts into a scuffle just as the company manager/leading lady Laura Keene enters to deliver a stern admonishment to the actors. At the sound of Hail to the Chief Keene walks onstage to welcome Abraham and Mary Lincoln, exhorting the audience to put war behind them and forget their cares for the evening of entertainment.As the theater curtain rises on an English country estate, Mary Dundreary (Laura Keene) is helping her forgetful father, Lord Dundreary (Ned Emerson), to locate a misplaced letter, which turns out to be from a backwoods American cousin, Asa Dundreary (Harry Hawk), announcing his imminent visit to Dundreary Manor to settle some ancient business. Overhearing news of the visit of a presumably wealthy American, Lady Mountchessington schemes with her daughter Gussy to secure Asa\'s hand in marriage. Arriving as if on cue, Asa confounds the pair with a coarse tale of herding possum on the frontier. Abraham Lincoln laughs heartily at the frontiersman\'s mannerisms, so comically resonant with his own public persona. The villainous Solicitor Coyle (Jack Matthews) informs Lord Dundreary that he now holds the deed to the family estate, and that only his daughter\'s hand in marriage will forestall ruin. As the family assembles for dinner, Asa is smitten with Mary Dundreary and instantly detects Coyle\'s plans. The rivals jockey for seats at a lavish dinner table as underfed soldiers from the theater audience look on with indignation.As Mary Dundreary leads an adoring Asa on a tour of her modern dairy, Asa spins a yarn of a deathbed bequest by his stepfather of sufficient money to save the Dundreary estate. Mary rushes off to tell her father of their salvation. Conversing quietly in their box, Abraham and Mary Lincoln look to their future after the presidency, while Booth, outside, rehearses for the assassination. Asa encounters the still eager Mountchessingtons, and having sacrificed his fortune to save the estate, declares himself penniless. As they escape from Asa\'s comic scorns, a shot is heard. Booth leaps from the presidential box and wields a knife at the paralyzed Hawk before fleeing. While the actors attempt to continue the play, Laura Keene tries to calm the crowd, which instead erupts calling for mercy and justice. Within the presidential box, Mary prepares for a life of mourning while a surgeon tends hopelessly to Lincoln. Laura Keene, seeing the wounded President lying on the bare floor, takes his head on her lap and cradles it. Matthews remembers Booth\'s letter in his pocket, and he and Hawk set fire to it just as the police arrive to arrest them for questioning. While Laura Keene is left to wander the stage wondering the value of her life in the theater, a shadowy figure approaches to ask her when the play will resume. Recognizing Lincoln in the figure Keene exclaims Don\'t you really know what happened? Upon Lincoln\'s silence, the audience chorus give a cryptic reply in the form of a recitation of the names of Civil War battlegrounds.'),(3856489,'K._Jayatillake','K.

He was born in Kannimahara, Gampaha District, Sri Lanka and was a contemporary of Mahagama Sekara having studied in the same school. He married Sumana Jayatillake and is the father of four children.K Jayatilake is one of Sri Lanka\'s topmost creative writers of the modern period of Sinhala literature. Using his close observations of village life, Jayatilake was a pioneer in the Sinhalese realistic novel. His first creative work, Punaruppattiya, a collection of short stories published in 1955, was well received. His award-winning novel and acknowledged masterpiece, Charitha Thunak, published in 1963, begins with a scene of peasants working in the field, evoking the intimate relationship between the villager and the earth. In this and other novels, Jayatilake reminds us also of the close-knit society of the village that is guided by common values.He died on September 14, 2011, at a private hospital in Colombo.'),(19484779,'Deep_Freeze_(software)','Deep Freeze (software).Deep Freeze, by Faronics, is an application available for the Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and SUSE Linux operating systems which allows system administrators to protect the core operating system and configuration files on a workstation or server by restoring a computer back to its original configuration each time the computer restarts.Operation.Deep Freeze is a kernel-level driver that protects hard drive integrity by redirecting information being written to the hard drive or partition, leaving the original data intact. This redirected information is no longer referenced once the computer is restarted, thus restoring the system to its original state at the disk sector level. This allows users to make \'virtual\' changes to the system, giving them the appearance that they can modify core files or even delete them, and even make the system unusable to themselves, but upon reboot the originally configured \'frozen\' state of the operating system is restored.To make changes, a system administrator must \'thaw\' the protected partition by disabling Deep Freeze, make any needed changes, and then \'freeze\' it again by re-enabling Deep Freeze. These changes become part of the protected partition and will be maintained after restarts. \'Freezing\' and \'thawing\' can be done at the workstation level or remotely via either the Faronics Core management platform or the Deep Freeze Enterprise Console. Users of the Enterprise version can also create virtual partitions called ThawSpaces (of up to 1 TB on an NTFS-formatted drive) to retain data on frozen hard drives after restarts.Deep Freeze can also protect a computer from harmful malware, since it automatically deletes (or rather, no longer sees) downloaded files when the computer is restarted. The advantage of using an application such as Deep Freeze antivirus / antimalware is that it uses very few system resources, and thus does not slow computer performance greatly. The disadvantage is that it does not provide real-time protection, therefore an infected computer would have to be restarted in order to remove malware.Limitations and security.Deep Freeze only protects workstations in a fresh-booted state. That is, Deep Freeze prevents permanent tampering with protected hard drives/partitions across reboots, but user activity between restarts is not limited by the program. For example, Deep Freeze does not prevent application installation; a user can install a modified version of a Web browser (but seemingly harmless to the unknowing user) designed to secretly send users\' passwords to a server connected to the Internet. As a workaround, Deep Freeze can be configured to restart after user logout, shutdown after a chosen period of inactivity, or restart/shutdown at a scheduled time in an attempt to ensure that no such installations are retained (as rebooting the system returns the system to its original, unmodified state).Deep Freeze cannot protect the operating system and hard drive upon which it is installed if the computer is booted from another medium (such as another bootable partition or internal hard drive, an external hard drive, a USB device, optical media, or network server). In such cases, a user would have real access to the contents of the (supposedly) frozen system. On a Windows-based computer, this scenario may be prevented by configuring the CMOS (nonvolatile BIOS memory) on the workstation to boot only to the hard drive to be protected, then password protecting the CMOS. This is a normal precaution for most public access computers. A further precaution would be to lock the PC case shut with a physical lock or tiedown cable system to prevent access to motherboard jumpers.Deep Freeze can protect hard drive partitions of larger than 2TB capacity (using NTFS).'),(48355436,'Heartbeat_(Carrie_Underwood_song)','Heartbeat (Carrie Underwood song).Heartbeat is a song recorded by American country music singer Carrie Underwood from her fifth studio album, Storyteller. Underwood co-wrote the song with Ashley Gorley and its producer, Zach Crowell. It was released to digital retailers on October 9, 2015, as the album\'s first promotional single. Country singer Sam Hunt, who is a frequent collaborator of Crowell\'s, sings backing vocals on the track, leading some publications to label the song a duet. It was confirmed at the American Music Awards of 2015 that Heartbeat would serve as the second single from Storyteller. Heartbeat was sent to country radio at 1:00 AM eastern time on the morning of November 23, 2015, and made its official radio impact on November 30, 2015.Composition.Heartbeat is a country pop and R&B song written by Carrie Underwood, Ashley Gorley, and Zach Crowell. It is a sentimental ballad composed in the key of D major and set to a slow tempo of 140 BPM. The song alternates between smooth verses with a relatively low-key musical accompaniment and a bombastic chorus. Sam Hunt provides background vocals on the chorus and bridge, with Underwood\'s vocals layered over top of his to creating a warm... echo effect.Described as the most real love song Underwood has recorded, the lyrics of Heartbeat relate to the feeling of intimacy experienced by being alone with one\'s lover. Critics noted a thematic similarity to then-recent single Smoke Break in that the song encourages finding time in a busy life for a private moment of bliss. The song appears to be inspired by Underwood\'s marriage to Mike Fisher.Commercial performance.In its first week of availability, Heartbeat sold 23,000 digital copies and debuted at number five on the Country Digital Songs chart dated October 19, 2015. That same week, it debuted on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart at number 26, and on the Billboard Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles extension chart at number 23.After its release as an official single, it debuted at No.41 on the Billboard Country Airplay chart and rose to number 32. It has sold a total of 105,000 copies as of January 2016.Heartbeat also entered the Hot Canadian Digital Songs chart at number 31, and became her first charting single in Scotland, debuting on the Scottish Singles Chart at number 80.Live performances.Underwood performed the song live at the 2015 American Music Awards on November 22, 2015.

Plays written after 1606 avoided such terms as a consequence of the act, and new editions of older plays removed profane words. Some scholars have argued that the Act had an important influence on the revision and publication of the plays of William Shakespeare.Impact on dramatic works.Many scholars and editors have argued that the act had a significant impact on English early modern drama. The need to comply with the act has been used to explain differences in editions of plays published before and after 1606, such as Othello by William Shakespeare and Volpone by Ben Jonson. However, Barbara Mowat has expressed reservations about the extent of the act\'s influence. She has highlighted the fact that the act only applied to dramatic performances, and thus changes to printed editions of dramatic works may have stemmed from other influences. These influences may have included changing cultural attitudes towards swearing, alterations made by particular scribes (such as Ralph Crane), and the desire to avoid offending particular individuals, such as Sir Henry Herbert, the Master of the Revels from 1624 to 1642.'),(31002740,'Westye_Parr_Egeberg','Westye Parr Egeberg.Westye Parr Egeberg (21 April 1877  2 February 1959) was a Norwegian military officer, businessperson and politician for the Conservative Party.Personal life.He was born in Kristiania as a son of Ferdinand Julian Egeberg (18421921).

As a sophomore he started for a young Radford High Team that went 1-12, where Hartman once gave up six goals in a half. That Radford High team won the Region IV Title in 1992 over Blacksburg High School and lost in the state semi-finals. RHS would have likely contended for the state title in 1992; however, between his sophomore and junior year at Radford High School, Hartman moved with his family to the Palos Verdes in California, where he enrolled in Palos Verdes High School, playing on the junior varsity squad for the 1990-1991 season.

They quickly found husbands among the predominantly male settlers, as well as a new life for themselves. They came mostly from poor families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France. A handful were ex-prostitutes, but only one is known to have practiced that trade in Canada. As farm wives with very good nutrition and high birth rates they played a major role in establishing family life and enabling rapid demographic growth. They had about 30% more children than comparable women who remained in France. Landry says, Canadians had an exceptional diet for their time. This was due to the natural abundance of meat, fish, and pure water; the good food conservation conditions during the winter; and an adequate wheat supply in most years. The American politician Hillary Clinton is a descendant of one of them.Besides household duties, some women participated in the fur trade, the major source of cash in New France. They worked at home alongside their husbands or fathers as merchants, clerks and provisioners. Some were widowed, and took over their husbands\' roles. A handful were active entrepreneurs in their own right.In the early 19th century down to the 1950s upper-class Anglos dominated high society in Montreal, and their women constructed and managed their identity and social position through central events in the social life, such as the coming out of debutantes. The elite young women were trained in intelligent philanthropy and civic responsibility, especially through the Junior Leagues. They seldom connected with the reform impulses of the middle class women, and for and were paternalistic in their views of the needs of working-class women.Cuba.Cuban women have equal constitutional rights as men in the economic, political, cultural and social fields, as well as in the family. According to article 44 of the Cuban Constitution, the state guarantees women the same opportunities and possibilities as men, in order to achieve womans full participation in the development of the country. Women hold 48.9% of the parliamentary seats in the Cuban National Assembly ranking sixth of 162 countries on issues of female participation in political life. There has been only one candidate per seat and the National Candidacy Commission decides the persons.Dominican Republic.Women in the Dominican Republic are women who live in or are from the Dominican Republic. Their character has been defined by their history, culture, tradition and experience. Constitutionally, the modern-day women of the Dominican Republic are equal to men in terms of rights and property ownership. Culturally, the women of the Dominican Republic have an attitude that is known as machista behavior, where women understood and to a certain degree accepted the machismo nature of Dominican Republic men. By tradition, Dominican Republic women are expected to be submissive housewives.El Salvador.Gender inequality can be found in various areas of Salvadoran life such as employment, health, education, political participation, and family life. Although women in El Salvador enjoy equal protection under the law, they are often at a disadvantage relative to their male counterparts. In 2009, the female labor force participation rate in El Salvador was 45.9 percent, compared to the male rate of 76.7 percent. In the area of politics, women have the same rights as men, but the percentage of women in office compared to men is dismal. In addition, the percentage of males in El Salvador with at least a secondary education in 2010 was 47.5, compared to females at 40.5 percent. Though much progress has been made since the Salvadoran Civil War ended in 1992, there is still more room for improving womens equality in El Salvador.Guatemala.Violence against women in Guatemala reached severe levels during the long-running Guatemalan Civil War (1960-1996), and the continuing impact of that conflict has contributed to the present high levels of violence against women in that nation. The total occurrences of femicide in Guatemala by the end of November 2011 were around 650 women killed; in 2010 the murder rate was 9 per 100,000 women, vice 41 per 100,000 for males.Haiti.Women in Haiti have equal constitutional rights as men in the economic, political, cultural and social fields, as well as in the family.However, the reality in Haiti is quite far from the law: political, economic and social features of Haiti negatively affect most Haitians, but Haitian women experience additional barriers to the full enjoyment of their basic rights due to predominant social beliefs that they are inferior to men and a historical pattern of discrimination and violence against them based on their sex. Discrimination against women is a structural feature in Haitian society and culture that has subsisted throughout its history, both in times of peace and unrest.Honduras.Honduras has experienced economic and social developments since the 1980s. These changes have been positive overall, bringing more gender equality and much higher quality of life for everyone, especially for the women of Honduras. Even with the improvements, there is still a long way to go in climbing the ladder and shrinking the gender gap that by the world\'s standards is gaping. On the 2011 Human Development Report, Honduras placed 121st out of 187 countries. The country\'s ranking specific to gender inequality is 105th out of 146 countries, with an overall value of 0.511 out of 1 in terms of HDI (with 1 representing perfect inequality). Many of the inequalities stem from longstanding cultural norms and traditions that have been in place for hundreds of years revolving around the tasks and roles played in the agricultural society of old gender roles in Mesoamerica. Many countries are held back by the traditions of their ancestors.Mexico.Women in Mexico are North American women or, at times may also be categorized as Central American women, who live in or come from Mexico. Julia Tun Pablos book Women in Mexico: A Past Unveiled (translated by Alan Hynds from the Spanish-language original Mujeres en Mxico: Una historia olvidada) traced and examined the history of Mexican women and their role from the pre-Corts era to the 1980s. According to Tun Pablos, the women of Mexico had been exalted in myth but had remained subordinated in their (...) role in Mexican society throughout Mexico\'s history.Panama.Women in Panama are the women who live in or are from Panama. Panamanian women, by tradition, are Hispanic and they are treated as equal to men, accorded with deference and respect. Young women in Panama, particularly those who are single, are regarded as persons with very high symbolic status, including giving them roles as Carnaval Queens. One particular example of this type of reverence of female adolescents is the celebration of the inna suid by the Kuna Indians, which is a three-day celebration of the adolescent girls\' coming of age. Some Panamanian women occupy high positions in the field of the professions, education, and government service. Panama had a female president as their national leader, in the person of Mireya Moscoso, who was Panama\'s first female president, serving from 1999 to 2004.Trinidad and Tobago.Women in Trinidad and Tobago are women who were born in, who live in, or are from Trinidad and Tobago. Depending from which island the women came from, the women of Trinidad and Tobago may also be called Trinidadian women or Tobagonian women respectively. Some women in Trinidad and Tobago now excel in occupations such as being microenterprise owners, lawyers, judges, politicians, civil servants, journalists, and calypsonians. Other women dominate in the fields of domestic service, sales, and some light manufacturing.Women of Afro-Trinidadian mix commonly become heads of households, thus with acquired autonomy and power. By participating in Trinidad and Tobago\'s version of the Carnival, Trinidadian and Tobagonian women demonstrate their assertive sexuality. Some of them have also been active in so-called Afro-Christian sects and in running the sou-sou informal rotating credit associations.United States.Women in the United States include the history of women in the United States since 1776, and the history of the Thirteen Colonies before that. The reliable sources on the topic were thin before the 1960s. Since then the study of Women\'s history has been a major scholarly and popular field, with many scholarly books and articles, museum exhibits, and courses in schools and universities.Puerto Rico.Puerto Rican women are women who live in and are from Puerto Rico, an island territory of the United States. They became citizens of the U.S.A. in 1917. Before that year - in 1898 - women form Puerto Rico were already active participants in the labor movement and agricultural economy in the island. During the period of industrialization, Puerto Rican women took jobs in the so-called needle industry, working as seamstresses in garment factories.U.S. Virgin Islands.Women in the United States Virgin Islands are women who were born in, who live in, and are from the Virgin Islands of the United States, a group of islands in the Caribbean that are an insular area of the United States, and is composed of the islands of St. Croix, St. John, and St. Thomas. According to Countries and Their Culture, the women of the U.S. Virgin Islands are participating increasingly in the fields of economics, business, and politics.British Virgin Islands.Women in the British Virgin Islands are women who were born in, who live in, and are from the British Virgin Islands, a British overseas territory located in the Caribbean. According to Countries and Their Culture, women of the British Virgin Islands are characteristically with strong independent and entrepreneurial spirit.Central America.Women living in Central America (or Middle America; see also Mesoamerica) may include those that are from Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. If the term women in Middle America, this regional grouping may include women from Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, Dominican Republic, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, and Trinidad and Tobago. If the term women in Mesoamerica is used, the women may come approximately from central Mexico to Belize, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua, and northern Costa Rica.For this article, only those women that are categorically from Central America are presented in this section.El Salvador.Gender inequality can be found in various areas of Salvadoran life such as employment, health, education, political participation, and family life. Although women in El Salvador enjoy equal protection under the law, they are often at a disadvantage relative to their male counterparts. In 2009, the female labor force participation rate in El Salvador was 45.9 percent, compared to the male rate of 76.7 percent. In the area of politics, women have the same rights as men, but the percentage of women in office compared to men is dismal.

The total occurrences of femicide in Guatemala by the end of November 2011 were around 650 women killed; in 2010 the murder rate was 9 per 100,000 women, vice 41 per 100,000 for males.Honduras.Honduras has experienced economic and social developments since the 1980s. These changes have been positive overall, bringing more gender equality and much higher quality of life for everyone, especially for the women of Honduras. Even with the improvements, there is still a long way to go in climbing the ladder and shrinking the gender gap that by the world\'s standards is gaping. In the 2011 Human Development Report, Honduras placed 121st out of 187 countries. The country\'s ranking specific to gender inequality is 105th out of 146 countries, with an overall value of 0.511 out of 1 in terms of HDI (with 1 representing perfect inequality). Many of the inequalities stem from longstanding cultural norms and traditions that have been in place for hundreds of years revolving around the tasks and roles played in the agricultural society of old gender roles in Mesoamerica. Many countries are held back by the traditions of their ancestors.Nicaragua.After the 1979 Nicaraguan Revolution in which the Sandinistas led by Daniel Ortega deposed the dictatorial president Anastasio Somoza Debayle, they implemented a number of social reforms, including trying to eliminate gender inequality and improve female literacy rates. They also encouraged women to participate in the fight for social justice and equality (Source: BBC: In Pictures: Sandinista Revolution remembered: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-10689502).Panama.Women in Panama are the women who live in or are from Panama. Panamanian women, by tradition, are Hispanic and they are treated as equal to men, accorded with deference and respect. Young women in Panama, particularly those who are single, are regarded as persons with very high symbolic status, including giving them roles as Carnaval Queens. One particular example of this type of reverence of female adolescents is the celebration of the inna suid by the Kuna Indians, which is a three-day celebration of the adolescent girls\' coming of age.

Panama had a female president as their national leader, in the person of Mireya Moscoso, who was Panama\'s first female president, serving from 1999 to 2004.South America.Women from South America include women who reside in Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay, and Venezuela.Argentina.Women in Argentina have attained a relatively high level of equality by Latin American standards, and in the Global Gender Gap Report prepared by the World Economic Forum in 2009, Argentine women ranked 24th among 134 countries studied in terms of their access to resources and opportunities relative to men. They enjoy comparable levels of education, and somewhat higher school enrollment ratios than their male counterparts. They are well integrated in the nation\'s cultural and intellectual life, though less so in the nation\'s economy. Their economic clout in relation to men is higher than in most Latin American countries, however, and numerous Argentine women hold top posts in the Argentine corporate world; among the best known are Cris Morena, owner of the television production company by the same name, Mara Amalia Lacroze de Fortabat, former CEO and majority stakeholder of Loma Negra, the nation\'s largest cement manufacturer, and Ernestina Herrera de Noble, director of Grupo Clarn, the premier media group in Argentina.Bolivia.Women in Bolivia face struggles in healthcare and cultural change, living in a country that is traditionally misogynist, although the constitution guarantees equal rights for women and men. Economically and politically, women have recently garnered more influence in decision making. According to the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme, in Bolivia men receive more and better education than women, receive increased and better health assistance than women, and have the possibility to generate greater income while working less...if we consider that women, as opposed to men, also have...the almost exclusive responsibility for domestic work. Maternal mortality and illiteracy among women rate as some of the highest in the world. Bolivian women are also exposed to excessive machismo, being utilized as promotional tools in popular advertising which solidifies stereotypes and assumptions about women.Brazil.Women in Brazil enjoy the same legal rights and duties as men, what is clearly expressed in the 5th article of Brazil\'s 1988 Constitution. A cabinet-level office, the Secretariat for Women\'s Affairs, oversees a special secretariat that has responsibility to ensure the legal rights of women. Although the law prohibits discrimination based on gender in employment and wages, there were significant wage disparities between men and women. However, many women have been elected mayors and many women have been federal judges. The first female assumed office in the Senate in 1979. Women became candidates for vice president for the first time in 1994. As of 2009, only 9% of the seats in the national parliament were held by women.Chile.The lives, roles, and rights of women in Chile have gone through many changes over time. Chilean women\'s societal roles have historically been impacted by traditional gender roles and a patriarchal culture, but throughout the twentieth century, women increasingly involved themselves in politics and protest, resulting in provisions to the constitution to uphold equality between men and women and prohibit sex discrimination.Women\'s educational attainment, workforce participation, and rights have improved, especially since Chile became a democracy again in 1990. Chile legalized divorce in 2004 and is also one of the few countries to have elected a female president. However, Chilean women still face many economic and political challenges, including income disparity, high rates of domestic violence, and lingering gender roles.-Colombia.As established in the Colombian Constitution of 1991, women in Colombia have the right to bodily integrity and autonomy; to vote (see also: Elections in Colombia); to hold public office; to work; to fair wages or equal pay; to own property; to receive an education; to serve in the military in certain duties, but are excluded from combat arms units; to enter into legal contracts; and to have marital, parental and religious rights. Women\'s rights in Colombia have been gradually developing since the early 20th Century.Ecuador.Women in Ecuador are women who live in or are from Ecuador, a country in South America. Ecuadorian women are generally responsible for the upbringing and care of children, and of husbands in Ecuador, and traditionally, men have taken a completely inactive role in this area. Recently, this has begun to change, due to the fact that more and more women are joining the workforce, which has resulted in men doing a little housework, and becoming slightly involved in the care of their children. This change has been greatly influenced by Eloy Alfaro\'s liberal revolution in 1906, in which Ecuadorian women were granted the right to work. Women\'s suffrage was granted in 1929.Guyana.Women in Guyana are South American women who lives in or are from Guyana. In general, Guyanese women plays significant roles in modern-day Guyanese society as house-workers, farmers, market vendors, teachers, nurses, civil servants, and clerks. A few women of Guyana have become senior position holders in the Government of Guyana; there had even been one Guyanese who took the role as the President of Guyana. Education-wise, women in Guyana have outperformed male Guyanese in regional examinations. There are currently more women in Guyana who attend education in universities.Paraguay.Women in Paraguay live in a culture that has been undergoing rapid change in recent decades. Women\'s rights were expanded through constitutional and legal changes during the 1990s. Cultural attitudes towards many areas of women\'s lives are also changing. Yet Paraguayan women still face many challenges in trying to attain social equality.The legal and government institutions that currently exist in Paraguay were developed in part through the efforts of feminist organizations in the country that held significant awareness-raising campaigns during the 1990s to formalize the guarantees of women\'s rights.The 1992 Constitution of Paraguay upholds the principle of equality for all individuals and prohibits discrimination. However, socio-cultural practises still support discrimination against women in some areas.Peru.Women in Peru represent a minority in both numbers and legal rights. Although historically somewhat equal to men, after the Spanish conquest the culture in what is now Peru became increasingly patriarchal. The patriarchal culture is still noticeable. Women receive less pay than men, have fewer employment and political opportunities, and are at times abused without repercussion. Contraceptive availability is not enough for the demand, and over a third of pregnancies end in abortion. Maternal death rates are also some of the highest in South America.The Peruvian Government has begun efforts to combat the high maternal mortality rate and lack of female political representation, as well as violence against women. However, the efforts have not yet borne fruit.Suriname.Women in Suriname are women who were born in, live in, or are from Suriname. Surinamese women may be ethnically East Indian (Hindostani), Mixed, Afro-Surinamese, Javanese, Maroon, Amerindian, or of other ancestry. Many women of Suriname work in the informal sector and in subsistence agriculture.Trinidad and Tobago.Women in Trinidad and Tobago are women who were born in, who live in, or are from Trinidad and Tobago. Depending from which island the women came from, the women of Trinidad and Tobago may also be called Trinidadian women or Tobagonian women. Some women in Trinidad and Tobago now excel in occupations such as being microenterprise owners, lawyers, judges, politicians, civil servants, journalists, and calypsonians. Other women dominate in the fields of domestic service, sales, and some light manufacturing.Women of Afro-Trinidadian mix commonly become heads of households, thus with acquired autonomy and power. By participating in Trinidad and Tobago\'s version of the Carnival, Trinidadian and Tobagonian women demonstrate their assertive sexuality. Some of them have also been active in so-called Afro-Christian sects and in running the sou-sou informal rotating credit associations.Uruguay.Women in Uruguay are women who were born in, who live in, and are from Uruguay. According to Countries and Their Cultures, there is a very high proportion of Uruguayan women participating in the labor force of the South American country. And that Uruguayan legislation maintains that the women of Uruguay have equal rights to power, authority, and privileges. In reality however women are still not occupying higher economic, professional, political, social, and religious positions. In relation to the political arena, UN Women reported that a 2012 study made by the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) ranked Uruguay as being 103rd out of 189 countries in terms of representation of women in Parliament and that only 12 per cent of the current members of the Chamber of Senators and Chamber of Deputies in Uruguay are women.Venezuela.Women in Venezuela are South American women who live in or are from Venezuela. The roles of Venezuelan women may differ in urban and rural areas. By tradition, women perform household work and they may accept jobs related to domestic services. In rural areas, Venezuelan women share demanding physical labor with men. Due to the rise of the beauty pageant industry, Venezuelan women have become highly regarded as objects of beauty and sexuality.French Guiana.Women in French Guiana were women living in or are from French Guiana. Some of these women are from the Maroon society of French Guiana. Although matrilineal in nature, some Maroon women in French Guiana once acted only as assistants or basia to the kabiten or male leader. A common job for the Maroon women in French Guiana include cleaning work in coastal areas, particularly in the markets of Saint-Laurent and Cayenne to earn income that would support their children.'),(25254023,'Bharat_Stage_emission_standards','Bharat Stage emission standards.Bharat stage emission standards are emission standards instituted by the Government of India to regulate the output of air pollutants from internal combustion engine equipment, including motor vehicles. The standards and the timeline for implementation are set by the Central Pollution Control Board under the Ministry of Environment & Forests and climate change.The standards, based on European regulations were first introduced in 2000. Progressively stringent norms have been rolled out since then. All new vehicles manufactured after the implementation of the norms have to be compliant with the regulations. Since October 2010, Bharat stage III norms have been enforced across the country. In 13 major cities, Bharat stage IV emission norms have been in place since April 2010.The phasing out of 2 stroke engine for two wheelers, the stoppage of production of Maruti 800 & introduction of electronic controls have been due to the regulations related to vehicular emissions.While the norms help in bringing down pollution levels, it invariably results in increased vehicle cost due to the improved technology & higher fuel prices. However, this increase in private cost is offset by savings in health costs for the public, as there is lesser amount of disease causing particulate matter and pollution in the air. Exposure to air pollution can lead to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, which is estimated to be the cause for 620,000 early deaths in 2010, and the health cost of air pollution in India has been assessed at 3 per cent of its GDP.History.The first emission norms were introduced in India in 1991 for petrol and 1992 for diesel vehicles. These were followed by making the Catalytic converter mandatory for petrol vehicles and the introduction of unleaded petrol in the market.On 29 April 1999 the Supreme Court of India ruled that all vehicles in India have to meet Euro I or India 2000 norms by 1 June 1999 and Euro II will be mandatory in the NCR by April 2000. Car makers were not prepared for this transition and in a subsequent judgment the implementation date for Euro II was not enforced.In 2002, the Indian government accepted the report submitted by the Mashelkar committee. The committee proposed a road map for the roll out of Euro based emission norms for India. It also recommended a phased implementation of future norms with the regulations being implemented in major cities first and extended to the rest of the country after a few years.Based on the recommendations of the committee, the National Auto Fuel policy was announced officially in 2003. The roadmap for implementation of the Bharat Stage norms were laid out till 2010. The policy also created guidelines for auto fuels, reduction of pollution from older vehicles and R&D for air quality data creation and health administration.Background information.The above standards apply to all new 4-wheel vehicles sold and registered in the respective regions. In addition, the National Auto Fuel Policy introduces certain emission requirements for interstate buses with routes originating or terminating in Delhi or the other 10 cities.In order to comply with the BSIV norms, 2 and 3 wheeler manufacturers will have to fit an evaporative emission control unit, which should lower the amount of fuel that is evaporated when the motorcycle is parked.Trucks and buses.Emission standards for new heavy-duty diesel enginesapplicable to vehicles of GVW > 3,500kgare listed in Table 3.More details on Euro IIII regulations can be found in the section on EU heavy-duty engine standards.Light duty diesel vehicles.Emission standards for light-duty diesel vehicles (GVW  3,500kg) are summarised in Table 4. Ranges of emission limits refer to different classes (by reference mass) of light commercial vehicles; compare the EU light-duty vehicle emission standards for details on the Euro 1 and later standards. The lowest limit in each range applies to passenger cars (GVW  2,500kg; up to 6 seats).The test cycle has been the ECE + EUDC for low power vehicles (with maximum speed limited to 90km/h). Before 2000, emissions were measured over an Indian test cycle.Engines for use in light-duty vehicles can be also emission tested using an engine dynamometer. The respective emission standards are listed in Table 5.4-wheel vehicles.Emissions standards for gasoline vehicles (GVW  3,500kg) are summarised in Table 6. Ranges of emission limits refer to different classes of light commercial vehicles (compare the EU light-duty vehicle emission standards). The lowest limit in each range applies to passenger cars (GVW  2,500kg; up to 6 seats).Gasoline vehicles must also meet an evaporative (SHED) limit of 2 g/test (effective 2000).3- and 2-wheel vehicles.Emission standards for 3- and 2-wheel gasoline vehicles are listed in the following tables.CO2 emission.India\'s auto sector accounts for about 18 per cent of the total emissions in the country. Relative emissions from transport have risen rapidly in recent years, but like the EU, currently there are no standards for emission limits for pollution from vehicles.Obligatory labelling.There is also no provision to make the emissions labeling mandatory on cars in the country. A system exists in the EU to ensure that information relating to the fuel economy and emissions of new passenger cars offered for sale or lease in the Community is made available to consumers to enable consumers to make an informed choice.Construction equipment vehicle.The limit values apply for both type approval (TA) and conformity of production (COP) testing. Testing is performed on an engine dynamometer over the ISO 8178 C1 (8-mode) and D2 (5-mode) test cycles.The Bharat Stage III standards must be met over the useful life periods shown in Table 11. Alternatively, manufacturers may use fixed emission deterioration factors of 1.1 for CO, 1.05 for HC, 1.05 for NOx, and 1.1 for PM.Agricultural tractors.Emission standards for diesel agricultural tractors are summarised in Table 12.Emissions are tested over the ISO 8178 C1 (8-mode) cycle. For Bharat (Trem) Stage III A, the useful life periods and deterioration factors are the same as for Bharat (CEV) Stage III, Table 11.Generator sets.Emissions from new diesel engines used in generator sets have been regulated by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India [G.S.R. 371 (E), 17 May 2002]. The regulations impose type approval certification, production conformity testing and labelling requirements. Certification agencies include the Automotive Research Association of India and the Vehicle Research and Development Establishment. The emission standards are listed below.Engines are tested over the 5-mode ISO 8178 D2 test cycle. Smoke opacity is measured at full load.Concentrations are corrected to dry exhaust conditions with 15% residual O2.Power plants.The emission standards for thermal power plants in India are being enforced based on Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 of Government of India and it\'s amendments from time to time. A summary of emission norms for coal- and gas-based thermal power plants is given in Tables 15 and 16.The norm for 500 MW and above coal-based power plant being practised is 40 to 50mg/Nm and space is provided in the plant layout for super thermal power stations for installation of flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) system. But FGD is not installed, as it is not required for low sulphur Indian coals while considering SO X emission from individual chimney.In addition to the above emission standards, the selection of a site for a new power plant has tomaintain the local ambient air quality as given in Table 17.However the norms for SOx are even stricter for selection of sites for World Bank funded projects (refer Table 18). For example, if SOx level is higher than 100 g/m 3, no project with further SOx emission can be set up; if SO X level is 100 g/m 3, it is called polluted area and maximum emission from a project should not exceed 100 t/day; and if SOx is less than 50 g/m 3, it is called unpolluted area, but the SOx emission from a project should not exceed 500 t/day. The stipulation for NOX emission is that its emission should not exceed 260gram s of NOX per Giga Joule of heat input.In view of the above, it may be seen that improved environment norms are linked to financing and are being enforced by international financial institutions and not by the policies/laws of land.Fuels.Fuel quality plays a very important role in meeting the stringent emission regulation.The fuel specifications of gasoline and diesel have been aligned with the Corresponding European Fuel Specifications for meeting the Euro II, Euro III and Euro IV emission norms.The use of alternative fuels has been promoted in India both for energy security and emission reduction. Delhi and Mumbai have more than 100,000 commercial vehicles running on CNG fuel. Delhi has the largest number of CNG commercial vehicles running anywhere in the World. India is planning to introduce Biodiesel, ethanol gasoline blends in a phased manner and has drawn up a road map for the same. The Indian auto industry is working with the authorities to facilitate for introduction of the alternative fuels. India has also set up a task force for preparing the Hydrogen road map. The use of LPG has also been introduced as an auto fuel and the oil industry has drawn up plans for setting up of auto LPG dispensing stations in major cities.Ineffectiveness of present pollution control system.Presently, all vehicles need to undergo a periodic emission check (3 months/ 6 months) at PUC Centres at Fuel Stations and Private Garages which are authorised to check the vehicles. In addition, transport vehicles need to undergo an annual fitness check carried out by RTOs for emissions, safety and roadworthiness. Independent centres do not follow rigorous procedures due to inadequate training Equipment not subjected to periodic calibration by independent authority Lack of professionalism has led to malpractice Tracking system of vehicles failing to meet norms non-existentComparison between Bharat Stage and Euro norms.The Bharat Stage norms have been styled to suit specific needs and demands of Indian conditions. The differences lie essentially in environmental and geographical needs, even though the emission standards are exactly the same.For instance, Euro-III is tested at sub-zero temperatures in European countries. In India, where the average annual temperature ranges between 24 and 28 degree Celsius, the test is done away with.Another major distinction is in the maximum speed at which the vehicle is tested. A speed of 90km/h is stipulated for BS-III, whereas it is 120km/h for Euro-III, keeping emission limits the same in both casesIn addition to limits, test procedure has certain finer points too. For instance, the mass emission test measurements done in g/km on a chassis dynamometer requires a loading of 100kg weight in addition to unloaded car weight in Europe. In India, BS-III norms require an extra loading of 150kg weight to achieve the desired inertia weight mainly due to road conditions here.Non-existence of limits.Various groups and agencies have criticised the government and urged the government of India to draft mandatory fuel efficiency standards for cars in the country, or at least to make the emissions labelling mandatory on all new cars in the country. The auto companies should inform the customers about a vehicle\'s emissions.Lag behind Euro standards.There has been criticism of the fact that the Indian norms lag the Euro norms. As of 2014, only a few cities meet Euro IV or Bharat Stage IV standards that are nine years behind Europe. The rest of India gets Bharat Stage III standard fuel and vehicles, which are 14 years behind Europe. Also, there was a suggestion from some bodies to implement Euro IV norms after Euro II norms, skipping the Euro III norms totally. This is because the Euro III norms are only a small improvement over Euro II, whereas Euro IV norms mark a big leap over Euro II. According to a study conducted by the Desert Research Institute and the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi, the only way to stabilise fine particulates (PM2.5) at the 2011 levels despite the five-fold rise in vehicular density is nationwide implementation of Bharat V standards by 2015.Cycle beating.For the emission standards to deliver real emission reductions it is crucial that the test cycles under which the emissions have to comply as much as possible reflect normal driving situations. It was discovered that manufacturers of engine would engage in what was called \'cycle beating\' to optimise emission performance to the test cycle, while emissions from typical driving conditions would be much higher than expected, undermining the standards and public health. In one particular instance, research from two German technology institutes found that for diesel cars no \'real\' NOx reductions have been achieved after 13 years of stricter standards.Need for uniform emissions standards across the country.The practice of limiting improved emissions standards only to a few cities and to a smaller proportion of urban population has been criticised as violating the fundamental right to healthy life for all. This also does not allow trucks to move to cleaner fuel and technology and they heavily pollute cities during transit and aggravate pollution in cities. Many persons and establishments try to purchase Bharat Stage III vehicles and fuel from outside city limits in order to take advantage of lower prices, even though these are used in cities.Regulatory framework.In India the Rules and Regulations related to driving license, registration of motor vehicles, control of traffic, construction & maintenance of motor vehicles etc. are governed by the Motor Vehicles Act 1988 (MVA) and the Central Motor Vehicles rules 1989 (CMVR). The Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport & Highways (MoSRT&H) acts as a nodal agency for formulation and implementation of various provisions of the Motor Vehicle Act and CMVR.To involve all stake holders in regulation formulation, MoSRT&H has constituted two Committees to deliberate and advise Ministry on issues relating to Safety and Emission Regulations, namely CMVR- Technical Standing Committee (CMVR-TSC).The National Standards for Automotive Industry are prepared by Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). The standards formulated by AISC are also converted into Indian Standards by BIS. The standards formulated by both BIS and AISC are considered by CMVR-TSC for implementation.Standing Committee on Implementation of Emission Legislation (SCOE).This Committee deliberates the issues related to implementation of emission regulation. Major functions of this Committee are Based on the recommendations from CMVR-TSC and SCOE, MoSRT&H issues notification for necessary amendments / modifications in the in Central Motor Vehicle Rules.In addition, the other Ministries like Ministry of Environment & Forest (MoEF), Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas (MoPNG) and Ministry of Non-conventional Energy Sources are also involved in formulation of regulations relating to Emissions, Noise, Fuels and Alternative Fuel vehicles.'),(33040526,'Mohamed_Mohamud_Ibrahim','Mohamed Mohamud Ibrahim.Mohamed Mohamud Ibrahim (,) (born in 1946 or 1947) is a Somali politician.Biography.From 2008 to 2011, Ibrahim lived in Harlesden in the United Kingdom, where he worked as an English support teacher at the Newman Catholic College.Since August 2011, he has served as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Somalia, under incumbent Premier Abdiweli Mohamed Ali and Foreign Minister Mohamed Abdullahi Omaar.'),(36102289,'Vicky_Pattison','Vicky Pattison.Victoria Vicky Pattison (born 16 November 1987) is an English television personality, columnist, writer and model, best known for appearing in the MTV show Geordie Shore from 2011 until 2014, Ex on the Beach in 2014 and 2015 and her own show Judge Geordie in 2015.Pattison won the fifteenth series of I\'m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! in December 2015 and is set to become a permanent member on the panel of the ITV daytime chat show Loose Women from January 2016 after a period of guest appearances.Early life.Before Geordie Shore, Pattison had various jobs, including working on the doors of some of Newcastle\'s top clubs and also in telesales.

Anti-Americanism has risen as a result of U.S. military drone attacks in Pakistan introduced by President George W. Bush and continued by President Barack Obama. In the aftermath of the 2010 Pakistan floods, flood victims directed anger at the US for not doing enough to deal with the humanitarian crisis, noting that the US spends $5 billion every month in the war in Afghanistan. These sentiments were further intensified due to the killing of Osama Bin Laden by American forces. Almost 60% of Pakistanis consider the U.S. an enemy. which has increased to 74% in 2012. Anti-Americanism has been provoked mainly as a reaction from those who are critical of American CIA activities in Pakistan, such as the infamous break-out of the Raymond Allen Davis incident and American intrusions from Afghanistan border such as the 2011 NATO attack in Pakistan. It has often confronted expatriate Americans in Pakistan too. According to a 2013 Pew Research Poll shows that 60% of Pakistanis view Americans either very unfavorably or somewhat unfavorably and according to the same poll conducted in 2014, 59% of Pakistans view the United States either very unfavorably or somewhat unfavorably.

In these churches, the President is the head of the Quorum of the Twelve.Position in the original Latter Day Saint church.When Joseph Smith organized the first Quorum of the Twelve of the Church of the Latter Day Saints in 1835, he ranked the members in order of seniority, by age. The oldestand therefore most seniormember was believed to be Thomas B. Marsh; he was designated by Smith as the quorum president. When new members were added to the quorum due to vacancies caused by death, apostasy, or excommunication, the new member was received as the junior member of the quorum, regardless of their age. The principle was established that the senior member of the quorum was to be its president.When Marsh was excommunicated from the church in 1839, Brigham Young was the senior member of the quorum, and he therefore became the President of the Quorum. Young still held this position when Smith was killed in 1844. As President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, Brigham Young claimed the authority to lead the church after Joseph Smith\'s death. The majority of Latter Day Saints endorsed Young\'s leadership; the church Young and his followers continued is today The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Other Latter Day Saint denominations were formed by Latter Day Saints who dissented from Young\'s leadership over the church.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.In the LDS Church, the President of the Quorum heads the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, the second-highest leadership body in the church. The identity of the quorum president is determined by apostolic seniority: the member of the quorum who has been an apostle for the longest period of time is the president of the quorum. When the President of the Church dies, the highest-governing body, the First Presidency, is dissolved and the Quorum of the Twelve becomes the governing body of the church. In every instance, the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles has been selected by the Quorum as the next President of the Church. Therefore, the senior apostle in the LDS Church is the President of the Church, and the second-most senior apostle is the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.The President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is set apart to the position and exercises priesthood keys of quorum presidency. The president conducts Quorum meetings and otherwise acts as administrative leader of the apostles.Due to the death of Boyd K. Packer on July 3, 2015, Russell M. Nelson becomes the new quorum president.Community of Christ.In the Community of Christ, the President of the Council of Twelve Apostles is the head of the church\'s Council of Twelve Apostles, the second-highest leadership body of the church. The quorum president is recommended by the First Presidency and is formally elected by the World Conference. The position is not based on seniority in the Council.As of 2014, the President of the Council of Twelve Apostles is Linda L. Booth; she is the first woman to serve in this position.The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite).In The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite), the President of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles is the administrative head of the Quorum of Twelve Apostles and is selected from its membership.

Following his removal from the bench, he remained in the territory where he was active in Republican politics and became an expert in mining law and water rights.Early life.Stilwell was born on May 24, 1849 in St. Lawrence County, New York to Mary (Brazee) and James Stilwell. He was educated in public schools at Ogdensburg, New York, Gouverneur Wesleyan Seminary, and Potsdam Normal School before his graduation from the Albany Law School in 1875.Following graduation, Stilwell moved to New York City where he worked for the legal firm of Peckham & Tremain.Stilwell\'s involvement in national politics began in July 1878.When President Rutherford B. Hayes replaced Chester A. Arthur with Edwin A. Merritt as Collector of the Port of New York, Stilwell became Merritt\'s assistant. In this role he acted as official secretary and also assisted the custom house\'s legal department.His promotion to the bench came when President Hayes gave Stilwell a recess appointment as Associate Justice to the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court. The new justice was commissioned on December 3, 1880 and arrived in the territory in February of the next year.Initially assigned to Prescott, at the time Chief Justice C. G. W. French was requesting reassignment away from the southern portion of the territory. When Stilwell had no objections, the 11th Arizona Territorial Legislature granted the Chief Justice his request and assigned Stilwell to oversee Cochise, Graham, Pima, and Pinal counties. During his time on the bench Stilwell authored no legal opinions as Chief Justice French reserved this task for himself.While on the bench, Stilwell became involved in several political disputes. As part of the efforts to force Governor John C. Frmont to either resign or return to the territory so he could perform his duties of office, Stilwell was proposed as a possible replacement. Conversely there were calls to have the judge removed from the bench. Complaints against Stilwell emphasized his supposed lack of experience and maturity. In a May 1881 letter from Tombstone attorney Thomas Fitch to Senator John Franklin Miller admitted that no specific actions justified Stilwell\'s removal but that the judge was still too inexperienced to remain. What importance a number of pending cases with large potential financial impact had on the call for the judges removal is unknown. The judges time on the bench came to an end on July 19, 1882 when President Chester A. Arthur nominated Wilson W. Hoover to replace Stilwell. The action was part of a mass removal that saw almost every territorial official replaced in the wake of Governor Frmont\'s resignation.No reason was given for Stilwell\'s removal and the judge was in California recovering from an illness at time he received the news.Following his removal, remained in Arizona and became a respected member of the legal community. He moved to Tombstone and opened a private legal practice. There he became an expert in mining law. Stilwell was a representative to the Republican territorial convention in 1888 and was elected to a two-year term as Cochise County attorney beginning in January 1889.Stilwell married Harriet Newell Bean, daughter of Southern Pacific Railroad official A. A. Bean, in 1885. The couple had three children, a son who died from an accident before reaching maturity and two daughters who reached adulthood. During their later years the couple separated with Mrs. Stilwell living in New York.After leaving his position as Cochise County attorney in 1891, Stilwell moved to Phoenix. About this time he was also considered for appointment as a United States Attorney. In 1894 the former judge joined with Henry N. Alexander to form the legal firm of Alexander and Stilwell. With the outbreak of the SpanishAmerican War, Stilwell was commissioned a major in the United States Army. Posted in Washington D.C. and San Francisco, California, the former judge served the paymaster department by developing a streamlined system for paying the troops. Following the war, Stilwell returned to his private legal practice.During his legal career, Stilwell argued multiple cases in front of the Arizona Territorial Supreme Court and appeared before the United States Supreme Court. While operating a general practice, his primary areas of specialization were mining law and water rights. His most influential case came when he joined with Joseph Henry Kibbey to represent the plaintiff in Slosser v. Salt River Canal Company (1901), 7 Arizona 376, a case that confirmed the Kibbey Decision that water rights belonged to the land they were associated with and not to the owner of the land.In 1916, Stilwell lost a primary contest for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator to Kibbey by a vote of 1857 to 4775. During the Republican state convention of 1928, Stilwell became ill. By the time he returned to his Phoenix home, the illness had become pneumonia.

The region is one of the world\'s most populated places, with a population density of, being about three times the world average of, although Mongolia has the lowest population density of a sovereign state. Using the UN subregion definitions, East Asia ranks second in population only to Southern Asia.Historically, many societies in East Asia have been part of the Chinese cultural sphere, and East Asian vocabulary and scripts are often derived from Classical Chinese and Chinese script. Sometimes Northeast Asia is used to denote Japan and Korea. Major religions include Buddhism (mostly Mahayana), Confucianism or Neo-Confucianism, Taoism, Chinese folk religion in China and Taiwan, Shinto in Japan, Shamanism in Korea, Mongolia and other indigenous populations of northern East Asia, and recently Christianity in South Korea. The Chinese Calendar is the root from which many other East Asian calendars are derived.History.The history of East Asia is predominantly the history of the Chinese Dynasties that dominated the region in matters of culture, trade as well as militarily, such as the Qin and the Han Dynasties. There are records of tributes sent overseas from the early kingdoms of Korea and Japan. There were also considerable levels of cultural and religious exchange between the Chinese and other regional Dynasties and Kingdoms.As connections began to strengthen with the Western world, China\'s power began to diminish. Around the same time, Japan solidified itself as a nation state. Throughout WWII, Korea, Taiwan, Eastern China, and Vietnam fell under Japanese control. Following Japan\'s defeat in the war, the Korean peninsula became independent, while Taiwan became part of the Republic of China.Uses of the term East Asia.The UNSD definition of Eastern Asia purely based on statistical convenience, but also other common definitions of East Asia contain the entirety of China, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia and Taiwan.Culturally, China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam are commonly seen as being encompassed by cultural East Asia.Alternative definitions.There are mixed debates around the world whether these countries or regions should be considered in East Asia or not.In business and economics, East Asia has been used to refer to a wide geographical area covering ten countries in ASEAN, People\'s Republic of China, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan. However, in this context, the term Far East is often more appropriate which covers ASEAN countries and the traditional countries in East Asia. Far East describes the region\'s geographical position in relation to Europe rather than its location within Asia. Alternatively, the term Asia Pacific Region is often used in describing the Far East region as well as Oceania.In contrast to the United Nations definition, East Asia commonly is used to refer to the eastern part of Asia, as the term implies. Observers preferring a broader definition of \'East Asia\' often use the term Northeast Asia to refer to the greater China area, the Korean Peninsula, Taiwan, and Japan, with Southeast Asia covering the ten ASEAN countries. This usage, which is increasingly widespread in economic and diplomatic discussion, is at odds with the historical meanings of both East Asia and Northeast Asia. The Council on Foreign Relations defines Northeast Asia as Japan and Korea.Culture.The culture of East Asia has been influenced by the civilization of northern China. East Asia shares a Confucian ethical philosophy, Buddhism, political and legal structures, and historically a common writing system. The relationship between Northern China and East Asia has been compared to the historical influence of Greco-Roman civilization on Europe.'),(36993221,'2012_Pakistan_floods','2012 Pakistan floods.The 2012 Pakistan floods began in early September 2012, resulting from heavy monsoon rains in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Upper Sindh, Southern Punjab and Balochistan regions of Pakistan.Flooding and impact.Initially according to the met Office forecasts, Pakistan was to receive below normal rainfall in 2012 and most of these areas were bracing for a drought.

Of the hundred or so native languages of Vanuatu, including Emae, not a single one is considered an official language of Vanuatu. The official languages of Vanuatu are Bislama, French and English. Most of the Emae people speak Emae, North Efate (Nguna), English, French and Bislama. Less than 1% of the people who speak Emae as their native language are literate in the language, while 50% to 70% are literate in their second language, whether it be Nguna, English, French or Bislama. Today, only around 400 people speak Emae, mainly in Makata and Natanga, 250 more than in the 1960s - around 150 speakers. According to Lewis, Emae is still underused by many of the people in the area, but 50% of children know and speak Emae (2014), and children speaking Emae will help the language thrive.Classification.Emae belongs to the large group of Austronesian language, which contains the more than 1200 languages. Continually, Emae is part of the Samoic-Outliers node also known as Polynesian Outliers. If there was a map of the Pacific, there would be a huge triangle enveloping all Polynesian languages within it. Emae is one of the few located outside of this triangle. The final node of Emae is the Futunic group and all languages part of this node are the sister languages of Emae - of which there are nine. The Futunic group comes from languages linked to the island of Futuna.Consonants.In Emae there are thirteen consonants that complete the alphabet: [p],[(m)b],[m] sometimes referred to as [mw], [f], [v], [t], [(n)d],[n], [l],[r], [s], [k] and [] - (Capell, 1962). According to Capell, [h] appears, but is a variant of [f] and sometimes [s]. Not classified as phoneme. The first five consonants, according to the phonetic alphabet, involve the lips with [v] and [f], while using the teeth. The two sets are described as bilabial (both lips) and labiodental (lip to teeth). The next set of letters, to [r] are all alveolar placement, which is the pressing of the tongue on the alveolar ridge. Finally, the letters [k] and [] are velar placements: the placing of the tongue on the back of the roof of the mouth. [] is a sound like in the word sing. For sounds like [p] and [b] the manner is plosive; plosive is a burst of air released from the mouth. A second way in which these consonants are made is nasal, where the sound is pushed through the nose. A third way is a fricative, a manner in which two objects in the mouth are pushed close to each other allowing only some are to pass. From the list of consonants, the letter [m] is the only letter that is considered an allophone. An allophone is a letter with multiple sounds, for example the [p] in pie and spy. For Emae, the only allophone is [m] and [m w]; the phoneme [m w] has a sound of muah.Vowels.The vowels of Emae are [a],[e],[i],[o] and [u]. Looking at the phonetic alphabet map of placement of the tongue of the vowels, the letter [i] is a front vowel and [u] is a back vowel. The height of the tongue also helps to contrast the sounds of the vowels, from the vowels from low to high are: [a], [e], then [i]. Like most Polynesian languages, Emae words can form diphthongs. A diphthong is when two vowels are placed right next to each other, an example in the Emae language would be the word sui for bone. For Emae, when two vowels are placed next to each other the lengthening of a vowel is an outcome. The lengthening of the vowels is denoted by the symbol : placed after the vowel. The lengthening of the vowel usually changes the meaning of the Emae word, for example a means 3rd person singular and a: means what (Capell, 1962). This is similar to the Polynesian language of Hawaiian where the kahak lengthens a vowel.Syllable structure and stress.To create a syllable in Emae the pattern is vowel or consonant-vowel only. The V and the CV pattern is shown in Polynesian, generally neighboring Melanesian languages except, Makura. Consonant-consonant sounds don\'t happen, so the sounds [mb], [nd] and [mw] are said to be single, pre-nasalized phonemes.When placing stress in a word the stress is usually placed on the third syllable from the end of the word, in Capells (1962) words: antepenultimate. An example antepenultimate word is nanafi, with the stress on na.Basic word order.Frantisek Lichtenberk says there are six sentence patterns; S(subject) V(verb) O(object), SOV, VSO, VOS, OSV and OVS with the last two being the most rare (Sato, 2012). Capell says the syntactic pattern of Emae is Melanesian, and can be shown by the comparison between the sentence pattern of Maori and Emae (1962).The pattern that Maori, a Polynesian language, follows is the VSO. Capell puts the structures in term of actor, predicate and goal. The actor is the subject, the predicate the verb phrase and the goal is the object of the sentence. Emae follows the SVO pattern, which is the structure that most Melanesian languages use.Reduplication.Reduplication in Emae is not as common as it is in other Polynesian languages. Most of the reduplication in Emae is a loan from other languages located around Emae. In Capells book he states that there is presence of both noun and verb reduplication in Emae (1962).Indigenous vocabulary.Most words in the Emae language are general Polynesian wordsHomophones.The homophones are regarded as interesting in Emae because, some of the time, one word is a general Polynesian word yet the other comes from another pacific language.Materials.There are no known documents in which the Emae language appears. Examples of these materials would consist of books, television, radio, and even YouTube. The only material of the Emae people is a short video of the people singing a hymn, not in Emae, but in the language of Bislama. This could lead to no records of the language, leading to its being regarded as endangered by some.Vitality.When trying to classify a language as endangered, linguists have to take into account other aspects of the languages uses in the area it is spoken. The use of the language in the daily life of the Emae people is an important piece of information in determining Emae\'s level of endangerment. According to Lewis, Emae is used in most domains (2014), yet this is a very vague statement because it does not specify the domains it refers to. This information can cause skeptics to have a different point of view. One domain in which a language might be used is at a religious gathering. While use in religious ceremony can be a way to preserve a language, there is no documentation of the Emea people using their language in this type of domain. For example in one of the villages, Makata or Natanga, the title of the hymnals was in Tongoan (Capell, 1962). Tongoan is small language no longer spoken on Emae located on the island of Tongoa. The second source came from a Youtube video of a VHS recording of a small congregation of Emae people singing a gospel song. Instead of using Emae the people were singing in Bislama, one of the official languages of Vanuatu. This presents another issue with the lack of documentation of Emae, as there are no audio recordings of the language. There is a small elementary school located in Emae called Nofo School, but it is unlikely that the language is taught there, as it is more popular to learn one of three official languages, which are spoken in the college on Efate. The use of official languages over indigenous languages and the lack of documentation of Emae are contributing factors to the endangered state of the language. There isnt any sign that Emae people have kept up with modern technology, or even radios, which would be a perfect domain to help the language spread and survive.Inter-generational transfer, or the transferring of a language to a younger generation, is also a predictor of a language\'s vitality. According to Lewis, the language is used by 50% of the children (2014),which is a positive sign for the language, as the children will help keep the language alive. In Capells book Reverend Herwell says that The population figures for [Makata and Natanga] are together now 157 (1962). With about 400-500 speakers recorded in 2001 the total number of Emae speakers more than doubled in over forty years, which supports that children of Emae have and still are learning the language, keeping Emae alive.'),(34513101,'Al_Batinah_North_Governorate','Al Batinah North Governorate.Al Batinah North Governorate is a governorate of Oman.

Jumping turnstiles, boarding buses through the back or very quickly through the front, and leaving doors open in subway stations are some tactics used. In some cases, transit operators obstruct the fare box to prevent anyone from paying. Often, fare strikes are used to protest against fare hikes and service cuts, but they can also organize solidarity between riders and drivers.History.The first historical mention of a fare strike in the United States was in 1944 in Cleveland, Ohio when streetcar workers threatened to refuse to collect fares in order to win a pay increase. The action was effective because the City Council gave in before they actually used the tactic. These kinds of social strikes, collective acts of refusal where workers continue to provide services (in this case, transit) but do not collect any money, have occurred in France and parts of Latin America.In 1969, Italy\'s Hot Autumn was sparked at FIAT\'s Mirafiori plant in Turin and spilled past the factory gates as workers coordinated movements using other forms of the social strike: FIAT workers refused to pay for the trams and buses and went into stores to demand reductions in prices, backed only by showing their factory ID badges. Others squatted houses and collectively refused to pay utility bills. These kinds of struggles spread throughout Italy until the end of the 1970s.Another type of social strike occurred during the 1970 postal strike in the United States when letter carriers promised to deliver welfare checks even while on strike. In 2004, much like in the 1944 example in Cleveland, the Chicago group Midwest Unrest was able to organize a fare strike that forced the Chicago Transit Authority to back down on service cuts and fare increases. In 2005, at least 5,000 riders participated in the first ever fare strike in Vancouver, Canada.In San Francisco, in 2005, Despite heavy police presence at major bus transfer points, at least a couple thousand passengers rode the buses for free in San Francisco on Thursday, September 1st - the opening day of a fare strike in North America\'s most bus-intensive city. Two of the main groups involved in organizing this were Muni Social Strike and Muni Fare Strike. Other community groups also participated, including the Chinese Progressive Association and the one major extension of the strike, through the participation of the day laborers\' organization in organizing among Spanish-speaking immigrants working class in San Francisco\'s Mission District, where the strike was most successful.In the United Kingdom, there were fare strikes against First Great Western in January 2007 and January 2008.In Montreal, striking students in 2005 often used the subway as a means of transportation during demonstrations. As a group, the demonstration would enter the subway without paying, usually while chanting Mtro populaire.In New York City, Occupy Wall Street activists chained and taped open service gates and turnstiles to the subway system to protest escalating service cuts, fare hikes, racist policing, assaults on transit workers\' working conditions and livelihoods  and the profiteering of the super-rich by way of a system they\'ve rigged in their favor on March 28, 2012.'),(43501783,'Luc_Beausoleil','Luc Beausoleil.Luc Beausoleil (born October 8, 1967) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player.Junior career.Beausoleil played junior hockey in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League (QMJHL) with the Laval Voisins and Laval Titan.

The film was directed by John G. Avildsen.Plot.Advertising executive Bill Compton (Patrick), his wife Joan (Audrey Caire), and daughter Melissa (Sarandon) are a wealthy family living in New York\'s Upper East Side. Melissa has been living with her drug dealer boyfriend. After Melissa overdoses and is sent to a hospital, Compton goes to her boyfriend\'s apartment to get her clothes. He confronts and kills the boyfriend in a fit of rage. At a nearby bar he hears factory worker Joe Curran (Boyle) ranting about how he hates hippies, and blurts out that he just killed one. Joe reacts favorably, but Compton says it was a joke.A few days later, Joe sees a news report about a drug dealer found slain a few blocks from the bar. He calls Compton and meets him. At first Compton is wary that Joe may be attempting blackmail, but Joe assures him that he admires Compton for killing the drug dealer. They become friends, and Compton and his wife have dinner at Joe\'s house with his wife. Melissa escapes from the hospital and returns to the family apartment, where she overhears her father discussing the murder. She storms out of the apartment house, saying to Compton, What are you gonna do, kill me too? Compton tries to restrain her, but she breaks away.Joe and Compton search for her, and meet a group of hippies at a bar in downtown Manhattan. They join the hippies at an apartment, where the hippies share their drugs and girlfriends with the pair. They then abscond with drugs brought by Compton, which he had taken from the drug dealer, as well as Joe\'s and Compton\'s wallets. Joe beats one of the girls until she tells him that their boyfriends often spend time in an upstate commune. Joe and Compton drive to that commune, with Joe bringing rifles. In a confrontation at the commune, Joe and Compton kill all the hippies there, and Compton unwittingly kills his own daughter.Reception and legacy.The film has garnered both critical acclaim and box office success. Produced on a tight budget of only $106,000, it grossed over $19.3 million in the United States, making it the 13th highest grossing film of 1970. Joe received mostly positive reviews from critics, earning an 86% Fresh rating on the review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes. Norman Wexler\'s screenplay received an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay.When Peter Boyle saw audience members cheering the violence in Joe, he refused to appear in any other film or television show that glorified violence. This included the role of Jimmy Popeye Doyle in The French Connection (1971). The role would earn Gene Hackman the Oscar for Best Actor. Boyle nevertheless played a ruthless gangster four years later in Crazy Joe and also appeared in the violent drama Taxi Driver. Joe inspired the creation of other tough, working class characters in 70s films and TV shows, including the character of Archie Bunker on the TV show All in the Family.In the 1980s, there were rumors that Peter Boyle might appear in a sequel to Joe. Citizen Joe, the sequel would follow Joe as he tried to rebuild his life after spending 10 years in prison and would also deal with his grown up kids who held more liberal beliefs, as Arville Garland had. Cannon Films periodically took out ads for unmade sequels to Joe. In 1980, Cannon promised Joe II then, in 1985, announced the coming of Citizen Joe: The man has changed but the times have not.... He\'s back. The film never materialized.Real-life parallel.Ten weeks before Joe was released in the United States, a real-life mass murder with similarities to the movie\'s climactic scenes occurred in Detroit, Michigan. On May 7, 1970, a railroad worker named Arville Douglas Garland entered a university residence and killed his daughter, her boyfriend and two other students.During pre-trial deliberations, Judge Joseph A. Gillis saw Joe and strongly advised both the prosecution and defense teams to do the same. He then carefully screened each member of the jury pool and excluded any who had seen the movie. He also forbade any seated juror from watching the movie or discussing it with anyone who had seen it. Although he brought with him multiple weapons and extra ammunition, Garland received a light sentence.Before and after sentencing, Garland received hundreds of letters from parents across the country who expressed sympathy with him. It was also reported that during the first weeks after his sentencing, he received no letters expressing outrage or condemnation of his actions.Soundtrack.Joe also featured an original soundtrack, introducing artists such as Exuma with the song You Don\'t Know What\'s Going On, Dean Michaels\' Hey Joe (not a version of the song made famous by the Leaves, Jimi Hendrix, and others), and other original songs by Jerry Butler and Bobby Scott.'),(48040170,'NGC_6286','NGC 6286.NGC 6286 is a spiral galaxy located in the constellation Draco.

The series was produced by Nelvana and began airing on October 13, 2006 in Canada on the network YTV. It features the voices of Sarah Gadon, Emily Hampshire, Peter Keleghan, and Adrian Truss.Franchise origins.The Ruby Gloom franchise that led to the television show was created by the American company Mighty Fine Ruby Gloom began as a stationery line, and was featured on pencil cases, backpacks, clothing, keychains, and plush toys which were sold through doeworld a subsidiary of Mighty Fine. Books were also made for the series, the first being Ruby Gloom\'s Keys to Happiness in 2004, as well as two calendars for 2004 and 2005. Ruby Gloom was depicted as a small girl with bright red hair, who wears a black dress and red and yellow striped socks. She has a pet cat named Doom Kitty, and was described as The Happiest Girl in the World. Ruby was originally marketed to the goth subculture, but was later adapted for kids. The product line had an interactive website where users could chat in a forum, and click around for free things such as desktop icons and screensavers. The words: Ruby Gloom is happy in her own way. Even though she is frowning, to her, a frown is only a smile upside down. In fact, Ruby is so happy, she could just die greeted viewers as they entered the website. Towards the end of 2004 the website changed to forum only dubbed The Mansion By the end of 2004 the website had been redesigned and featured an interactive mansion to explore and user submitted artwork. Ruby is shown on the roof with her cat Doom and was given a smile for the first time. By 2006 The Mansion forum was removed, and the website had taken on its show format geared more towards kids.Ruby Gloom.Ruby is a young girl who can find happiness in anything. Look on the bright side is her mantra. There isn\'t a single thing in the world that gets her down or a single negative that she can\'t turn into a positive. Her positive attitude allows her to act as the voice of reason in the mansion when her friends lose focus on real issues. Ruby has a crush on one of her friends, Skull Boy, and nearly reveals her feelings to him in the episode Sunny Daze, when the two of them are trapped in a cave. Her positive outlook also makes Ruby very loyal to her friends. She likes to write in her diary and knit. Voiced by Sarah Gadon.Doom Kitty.As Ruby\'s pet cat, Doom Kitty has a complete free run of the mansion and is therefore usually the only one with total knowledge of what is going on in any given area of the house. This keeps her one step ahead of Ruby and the others most of the time, because whenever something strange happens in the mansion, Doom Kitty will usually have all the facts already while everyone else is still trying to figure things out. Unfortunately, since Doom Kitty can\'t talk, her only hope of communicating with the others is through mime with violin noises. Ruby usually has an easy time understanding her, but it doesn\'t always work. This shows that Doom Kitty hates it when she is trying to communicate, and her friends think that she is playing charades. She sometimes tries to warn Scaredy Bat about Boo Boo\'s pranks.Iris.Like Ruby, Iris goes through life without a care in the world, but in a much different way. Where Ruby finds happiness in anything, Iris finds adventure. From safaris to fighting wild animals to even shooting herself out of a cannon, there isn\'t a single thing this cyclops girl won\'t try at least once, as long as she thinks it\'s fun. Unfortunately, Iris\'s adventuresome nature also makes her quite impulsive and she has a bad habit of jumping into a situation without considering potential consequences. This usually results in trouble she doesn\'t expect. However, as soon as the trouble is gone, she\'s off again on another adventure. Voiced by Stacey DePass.Misery.Misery doesn\'t mean to be a walking disaster area. Her mishaps are usually a combination of clumsiness and extraordinary bad luck. Evidently, these traits run in her family, as Misery has had relatives who have been present at every single major disaster in recorded history. Fortunately, her friends are all kindhearted enough to take this in stride. Misery spends most of the time in a state of detached apathy and with ever-present trails of tears running from her eyes. She does have tiny moments of happiness throughout the series, but unless they\'re few and far between, her bad luck rears its ugly head and strikes her down with a vengeance, usually in the form of lightning bolts. She sometimes also states to be happy, although she is in her usual melancholic mood. Friday the 13th is the only time her inherent bad luck gives her a break; nothing but good things happen to her while everyone around her gets a day-long dose of Misery\'s bad luck, but she seems to hate the good luck as it is a day that\'s completely different from what\'s she\'s used to. Sugar is also something that Misery needs to stay away from, because whenever she has any sweets, she goes into a hyperactive frenzy, running around spouting everything that has ever gone wrong in the history of the world, from major catastrophes like an earthquake in China to small non-events like stubbing her toe in the kitchen. She keeps dust bunnies as pets, though she is allergic to them and blows them away with her sneezing. They appear to like her, as they return to her every time. Despite these problems though, Misery has actually been revealed to be an incredibly gifted singer. However, this talent only shines through whenever she\'s asleep. Otherwise, her singing just comes out as banshee-like screams. This made Frank and Len recruit her as lead singer for their band, R.I.P., during a major concert event, Gloomapalooza. Their performance was a huge success. Her family is surprisingly large, considering how often they find themselves in or responsible for disasters, and when the entire family meets, the destruction can be impressive, for example, in the episode Misery Loves Company, Misery\'s cousins Malady and Malaise come to visit. When both of them are in the same place at once, destruction occurs. Ruby manages to arrange it so one cousin could be with Misery at a time, while the other cousin is doing something else. Also, in the episode I\'ll Be Home For Misery, when Misery\'s family comes to call, only her female relatives come (with the exception of Cousin Murky, Skull Boy\'s persona during the episode). It is stated in the episode Disaster Becomes You that all the males in Misery\'s family but one, who is suggested to be her father, died in quicksand. Voiced by Emily Hampshire.Skull Boy.A man of many talents, Skull Boy is the mansion\'s official Jack of All Trades. From film directing to private investigating, Skull Boy can pretty much do it all. His only problem is that he can\'t seem to find one thing and stick to it for any serious length of time. But if Skull Boy doesn\'t know where he\'s going, it\'s mostly because he doesn\'t know where he comes from. This is referred to in many episodes when each time he finds a new skill he surmises his must come from a long line of others with that same skill, indicating he knows little to nothing about his origins. There have been several moments that confirm that Ruby has a crush on him, such as in the episode Quadro-Gloomia when Frank and Len get inside Ruby\'s head and experience her feelings for Skull Boy first hand. Even though Skull Boy doesn\'t know where he is from, he has a family - his friends are his family. Voiced by Scott McCord.Frank and Len.Rockers by nature, these conjoined brothers live in the mansion\'s garage. They have their own garage band, known as R.I.P (pronounced RIP). Frank and Len\'s strength lies in performing music. Unfortunately, this seems to be all that is their strength, since they both tend to lose focus on anything that isn\'t their music. They can hardly focus on something if it doesn\'t have a beat. Frank is actually the more intelligent of the two, often getting annoyed at Len\'s lack of understanding. Len is the more sentimental one, who seems to have a thing for small animals and things that don\'t exactly matter to anyone else. Even though they seem upbeat for their music, the two of them are almost never on the same page, even though they\'re conjoined. Despite this fact, Frank and Len are close. For example, in the episode Quadrogloomia, when the brothers needed a way to become unconscious, they were unable to hit each other over the head with planks. Another example of this is in the episode Iris Springs Eternal where Ruby, Frank, and Len were sliding down a mud slide when Frank states, Len, if we don\'t get out of this I just want you to know that you\'ve been the best brother a brother could have for a brother. Len replies with same here. Also, as of the episode Quadrogloomia, Frank and Len are the only housemates (other than Doom Kitty) who know about Ruby\'s crush on Skull Boy. Voiced by David Berni (as Frank) and Jeremy Harris (as Len).Edgar, Allan, and Poe.Poe, along with his brothers Edgar and Allan, live in an attached addition to the mansion. However, out of the three, Poe is the one seen most often. Edgar and Allan are rarely seen and when they are, they never speak but act as Poe\'s bodyguards and servants since they are taller than him. Poe meanwhile, as a man of culture and sophistication, likes to think of himself as a role model to the rest of the mansion\'s residents. Unfortunately, he tends to be a little too attached to his image and likes to cover up the parts of him that make him look like less than what he makes himself out to be. For example, he\'d rather tell people he\'s performing in an actual opera than admit that he\'s staying home to listen to opera records. Poe\'s pampered nature also tends to make him overreact to things that everyone else would more or less take in stride. There is at least some evidence that Poe\'s cultured accent is an affectation. In episode Unsung Hero, Poe reverts to an East End accent while speaking to Skull Boy. Skull Boy remarks that Poe\'s Oxford accent has vanished much to Poe\'s discomfort. Poe is fond of claiming to be a descendant of Edgar Allan Poe\'s pet budgie Paco, which is proven in the episode Time Flies. Poe is voiced by Adrian Truss.Scaredy Bat.Scaredy Bat is a bat with an Indian accent who is afraid of almost everything. Where Ruby finds happiness and Iris finds adventure, Scaredy Bat finds only fear. Despite being a bat, he\'s afraid of flying and is also afraid of the dark. He\'s also afraid of his own reflection. This constant state of fear is perfect for Boo Boo, the mansion\'s ghost, since Scaredy Bat is the only one who is afraid of him. The only thing he\'s not afraid of is a crumpet. Even if his fear sometimes gets the better of him, Scaredy Bat is the loyal and talented drummer of Frank and Len\'s band, R.I.P. When he is behind the kit, Scaredy Bat is a beat machine and forgets his fear. He also enjoys eating mosquitoes. Voiced by Peter Keleghan.Boo Boo.The mansion\'s ghost, Boo Boo sees it as his job to haunt. However, it\'s a little difficult for him to do that when everyone thinks he\'s cute, and he hates being thought of as cute. In the episode Doom with a View, (Boo Boo\'s first appearance in the series), he takes exception to the other characters referring to his cuteness when they first see him. When he first arrived at the mansion, Boo Boo wasn\'t an official ghost in that he couldn\'t phase through walls and only Doom Kitty, Ruby\'s cat, could see him. According to the leaders of the Ghost Family (two large, mobster-type ghosts who go by the names of Mr. White and Mr. White), Boo Boo couldn\'t become a full ghost until he had scared at least one person and Ruby\'s mansion was the house they\'d selected for him. But since Boo Boo couldn\'t go through walls and Doom Kitty was the only one in the house who could see him, his job was very difficult. However, when Doom Kitty splashed milk on him to reveal his presence, Boo Boo got a slight scare out of Misery when he almost splashed milk onto a tablecloth once owned by her great-great-really-great-grandmother. However, it was enough of a scare for Boo Boo to become a full-fledged ghost, since he can now phase through walls and everyone can now see him. After that though, his only real motivation for staying in the mansion has been to scare Scaredy Bat, as he hasn\'t been able to scare anyone else since. However, Boo Boo enjoys pranking more than he enjoys scaring. Despite this, he and Scaredy Bat have shown to be good friends. Voiced by Barbara Mamabolo.Mr. Buns.Mr. Buns is a stuffed rabbit that Ruby created from one of her leftover socks. The floppy, yet enigmatic Mr. Buns loves tea cozies and pretty much finds himself in the middle of almost all the action in the mansion. He also has a strange tendency to show up anywhere and do random tasks off screen.Mr. White and Mr. White.These two large ghosts are the mentors and teachers of young Boo Boo in his learning to be a ghost. Distinguished by their glasses and high rank within The Family, they typically act in a mafia orientated manner (even having their own pasta making skit and Italian music playing in the background), often threatening to take Boo Boo away if he does not complete enough scares or if he is pulling pranks, such as the line Less Taunt. More Haunt. Noticeably, the Mr. White with the hat is a higher rank than the other Mr. White, who is usually driving their mode of transport.Squig.A large flying worm that Iris made friends with in her travels. Although he is not often seen, he accompanies Iris on all her adventures as both her companion and sometimes her mode of transport. He is about five times as big as Iris, and is black and red with patterns down his back, and has a small set of wings at the end of his tail. According to Iris, he can fly because nobody ever told him he can\'t.Venus.Another of Iris\'s many pets, Venus is a venus flytrap. When Venus first appeared, she was very voracious and typically acted as a pet. However, after she ate the heart that Skull Boy made in the episode Science Fair or Foul, she became much more caring and knowledgeable, eventually becoming a successful writer and being able to speak very eloquently, as seen in the skit Suspense Writing with...?. Venus speaks with a thick French accent, because the record Iris used to teach her was dictated by a French man.Mr. Mummbles.Ruby\'s nextdoor neighbour, Mr. Mummbles lives in a glass house with his pet, a frog named Socrates. Mr. Mummbles received his name from Poe in the episode Poe-Ranoia, where Poe thought that he was a murderer, and since then the name has stuck. After a revelation that Mr. Mummbles designs and creates amusement park rides, he can be seen in later episodes testing these new rides. His rides are designed to make people happy, sometimes having features that tickle the passengers. Mr. Mummbles also follows the rule Safety First, however his rides seem to bend in the opposite direction to being safe, which includes massive spirals, gaps and fire on the tracks.Malady and Malaise.These two sisters are Misery\'s cousins, who, when both are together, cause a localized ice age. Malady is the one character that is more disease-prone than her cousin, Misery. She apparently suffers from every known disease, ailment, illness, symptom and allergy almost simultaneously, and when asked about them, she runs through all the events and procedures that lead to one injury, which usually lasts hours until the conclusion. Malaise suffers from narcolepsy and can often be seen lying on a couch or bed or even asleep on the floor randomly. She is accompanied by many creatures including a snake, spiders, an octopus, snails and butterflies, which usually attach themselves to the full-body veil she wears. Despite their faults, Misery loves her cousins.The Skele-Tunes.A group of Jazz/scat/Cajun musicians that befriend Skull Boy (referring to him as SB). The band contains four skeletons. The vocalist is the jazzy Skele-T, instantly recognized by his outfit, ear hole rings and gold tooth. The other skeletons each have a different instrument, one with an accordion, one with a tuba and one using his rib cage as a xylophone. They are shown to be Jokers, disappearing and joking around with Skull Boy. Skele-T does most of the talking, using jazz slang and phrases, such as You\'re straight from the fridge daddio and throwing in skeleton puns like You fracture me instead of You crack me up. When Skull Boy leaves to try and find his roots, Skele-T even invites him to join their band, but he refuses due to a case of homesickness.Misery\'s Cousins and Ancestors.Mayhem - A cavegirl that resembles Misery. It is shown that she possesses great physical strength and little intelligence. It is implied that she chased away the dinosaurs, and is very sad that they\'re gone. She chases Scaredy Bat throughout the episode I\'ll Be Home For Misery, shouting Here Birdy, Birdy, Birdy. She is also seen in the episode, Time Flies.Mildew - A Japanese geisha that resembles Misery. She speaks in respectful tones but clashes the most with Mayhem and Migraine. Unlike her relatives, Mildew has normal colored eyes and skin.Migraine - Arriving on the Titanic, Migraine usually has her arms back yelling I\'m the queen of the world. She also talks like a valley girl and has a Hawaiian flower in her hair. She is also seen in the episodes Time Flies and Disaster Becomes You.Morose - Truly goth, Morose has dyed green/black hair and green and black striped stockings. Very thick streaks of eyeshadow run down her face because it mixes with her tears. She is also a singer who unlike Misery, can sing while awake and performs a song with Frank & Len while playing keyboards. The boys love it until their house falls in around her. One of Morose\'s only happy moments in Gloomsville is when she said cool... another verse?. Misery calls her Aunt Morose in the episode Sunny Daze.Mopey - The optimistic member of Misery\'s family, she has hair just like Ruby\'s, which Ruby compliments and Mopey says Right back atcha!.Motley - Burnt in the great fire of London, Motley has almost no hair left and seems generally singed all over with the bit of remaining hair on fire.Myopic, Malice and Misbegotten - The triplets are little kids that seem pretty happy for members of the misery family. They dance and laugh around Morose leading Morose to wail Children, Cheerful, Playful Children... Why?! Why?!.In addition to these named family members, four others are shown. A relative that resembles Misery in a French Peasant Maid\'s outfit, who plays drums while Morose sings and plays her keyboard, another relative in a Medieval Princess gown and pointy hat (who appeared in the episode Disaster Becomes You), one dressed as a 1970s soul sister with a white streak of hair like Frankenstein\'s bride, and one with white hair in braided pigtails curved up like bullhorns with a spider web in the middle.The end of the episode suggests that the entire reunion was a dream, so the question remains how many of them are actually Misery cousins (such as Malady, Malaise, Mayhem, etc.) and how many are from Misery\'s imagination as they just look like Misery in different getups from other episodes (Motley, Mopey, the 1970s Soul Sister, etc.).Bunny.A pink bunny with red eyes, he pretends to be a cute and loving bunny with a cold, but is actually evil. He wanted to steal everything from Ruby\'s mansion. Doom Kitty was the only one who knew he was evil. Later everyone else finds out this bunny is evil when Doom Kitty cages him and everyone saw their stuff in his carriage, so they kicked him out.Episodes.These are the episodes that have aired on television.

It was one of four state mental asylums built on Long Island (the others being Kings Park State Hospital, Central Islip State Hospital, and Pilgrim State Hospital), and was the last one of the four to be built.The hospital was built in the early 1940s, believed to be a Works Progress Administration-funded project. It consisted only of ten buildings (including its massive, prominent 13-story main building), making it the smallest of the four as well (although it was planned to be a larger complex, those plans never made it past paper). The facility was commandeered by the War Department after the United States entered World War II. The War Department completed its construction for use as a psychiatric facility for battle-traumatized soldiers. Its entire campus (in addition to three buildings from nearby Pilgrim State Hospital and numerous temporary structures) was used as Mason General Hospital by the department.When the war ended, the hospital was transferred back to New York State, where it essentially operated as the tubercular division of Pilgrim for a few years. In 1946 film director John Huston was assigned by the U.S government to film a documentary film about recovering soldiers in the hospital for propaganda purposes, the film was called Let There Be Light.Advancements in medicine throughout the 1950s and 1960s that offered alternatives to institutionalization led to decentralization, and the hospital closed in 1971. From that point on it was left to the mercy of vandals, arsonists and time. Its main building and a handful of other structures were demolished in stages throughout 1989. The final remaining structures were disposed of around 199091.Today, the site sits as an open, state-protected oak-brush plains preserve under the NYS DEC department. One can still find remnants of the former hospital, such as the old rail spur, fire hydrants, etc., scattered about. People can obtain a free DEC for access to the preserve. Activities include hiking, biking, dog training, and model airplane flying.'),(7944474,'Beach_Handball_World_Championships','Beach Handball World Championships.The Beach Handball World Championship is a biannual beach handball competition for women and men national teams.

The couple had married in Colombo, Sri Lanka, and had moved to London, where Ulrik was working as an architect. Yohanan inherited both Israeli and Danish citizenship through his parents (he renounced his Danish citizenship in 2009 as a condition for being allowed to remain a Knesset member). In 1972, when Yohanan was two months old, the family moved to Israel and settled in Jerusalem, where his father opened an office and became a city architect.Plesner grew up in Jerusalem, and during his national service in the Israel Defense Forces from 1989 to 1994, he served as an officer with the Sayeret Matkal commando unit. He went on to study at the prestigious Amirim Program of Excellence at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, where he gained a BA with distinction in economics.

During his time in the legislature, Plesner spoke out on issues ranging from national security and electoral reform to preservation of the environment and excellence in education.The Knesset Ethics Committee censured Plesner in 2011 for making insulting and harmful comments that are not connected to political stances and public life, but rather an MKs personal life. Plesner, during a Haneen Zoabi speech on the Gaza Flotilla, said of Zoabi, I only hope that you go to Gaza for a week and see what happens to you, a single 38-year-old woman. He added, Dont worry, just like no man would touch you, we will not touch you either.Plesner was, in 2012, Deputy Chairman of the Kadima Faction and a member of both the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee and of the Defense and Foreign Relations Committee.

He plays hurling with his local club Carrigtwohill and has been a member of the Cork senior inter-county team since 2002.Club.McCarthy plays his club hurling and Gaelic football with his local club in Carrigtwohill and has enjoyed some success. He first came to prominence on the club scene as a member of the club\'s minor football team in 1998. That year Carrigtwohill reached the final of county minor championship. The Tadgh MacCrthaigh\'s club provided the opposition on that occasion and went on to defeat McCarthy\'s side.McCarthy later joined the Carrigtwohill under-21 teams. In 2001 he lined out in the final of the county under-21 championship with Glen Rovers providing the opposition. The Glen proved too strong on that occasion and won the game by 2-9 to 2-6.In 2002 McCarthy was a key member of the Carrigtwohill senior team. That year the club reached the final of the county intermediate championship. McCarthy\'s side line dout against Delaney\'s on that occasion and, after an exciting hour of hurling, the game ended in a draw. A week later both sides met in the replay, however, McCarthy\'s side narrowly lost out by 1-13 to 0-14.It was 2006 before Carrigtwohill reached the decider of the premier intermediate championship again. McCarthy was one of the key men in the forward line as Bishopstown provided the opposition. Disappointment and defeat were McCarthy\'s lot as \'the town\' easily won the game by 0-20 to 1-11.A year later McCarthy\'s club had as chance of redemption when they reached the intermediate final for the second consecutive year. Watergrasshill were the opponents in that game and an exciting and tense hour of hurling followed. At the full-time whistle Carrigtwohill were the winners by 3-14 to 3-12 and McCarthy finally collected a premier intermediate winners\' medal.In 2011 Carrigtwohill made it to the Cork Senior Hurling Championship for the first time since 1935 where they faced a start studded Cork Institute of Technology team. Despite entering the game as underdogd McCarthy\'s team cased a hugh shock and ran out 0-15 to 1-11 winners to take the title for the first time since 1918.Minor, under-21 & intermediate.McCarthy first came to prominence on the inter-county scene as a member of the Cork minor hurling team when he was just sixteen years-old in 1998. In his debut season he failed to make the starting fifteen, however, he came on as a substitute in the Munster final. Clare were the opponents on this occasion but they were no match for Cork. A 3-13 to 0-8 score line gave Cork the victory and gave McCarthy a coveted Munster winners\' medal. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Cork take on Kilkenny. McCarthy came on as a substitute once again as \'The Rebels\' proved too strong for their greatest rivals. A 2-15 to 1-9 score line gave Cork the win and gave McCarthy an All-Ireland minor winners\' medal.By 2001 McCarthy was a member of the Cork intermediate hurling team. That year he collected a Munster winners\' medal in that competition as \'the Rebels\' defeated Clare by 1-120 to 1-11. McCarthy\'s side later reached the All-Ireland decider and faced Wexford. Cork\'s hurlers proved too strong once again and defeated the Leinster champions by 2-17 to 2-8, giving McCarthy and All-Ireland winners\' medal in this grade.By this stage McCarthy had joined the Cork under-21 hurling team. After little success in 2001 and 2002, Cork reached the provincial decider. Tipperary were the opposition and, after an exciting game that featured extra-time, Cork were eventually defeated by 2-14 to 0-17.Senior.McCarthy\'s performances in the other grades of hurling brought him to the attentions of the Cork senior selectors. He made his debut in the 2002 National Hurling League with Cork reaching the final of that competition. McCarthy lined out at wing-forward in that game against Kilkenny. A close match developed, however, \'the Cats\' secured a narrow 2-15 to 2-14 victory. McCarthy later made his championship debut that year, however,Cork, showing little or no appetite for battle, were eliminated by Galway in the second round of the qualifiers that year.While the Cork hurling team should have gone from strength to strength as a result of a solid foundation at minor and under-21 levels the opposite happened. A series of embarrassing defeats saw the Cork hurling team reach rock bottom and call a players\' strike just before Christmas in 2002. Had the strike failed it could have meant the end of his and his teammates\' careers, however, in the end the county board relented and met the demands. Although still amateur sportsmen the Cork senior hurling team were treated as professional athletes.In 2003 Corks players were vindicated in taking a stand as the team reached the Munster final for the first time in three years. Waterford provided the opposition on that occasion as one of hurlings modern rivalries began in earnest. An exciting game resulted between the two teams; however, victory went to Cork by 3-16 to 3-12. It was McCarthy\'s first Munster winners\' medal in the senior grade and it gave a signal that Cork were back. Cork were hot favourites going into the subsequent All-Ireland semi-final against Wexford, however, it was far from a walkover. In one of the most exciting games of the championship both sides finished level: Cork 2-20, Wexford 3-17. Both sides met again six days later with Cork making no mistake and taking the spoils on a score line of 3-17 to 2-7. This win set up an All-Ireland final meeting with Kilkenny. In another thrilling game of hurling both teams were level for much of the game, exchanging tit-for-tat scores. A Setanta  hAilpn goal steadied the Cork ship, however, a Martin Comerford goal five minutes from the end settled the game as Kilkenny went on to win by 1-14 to 1-11.2004 saw Cork reach the Munster final once again and, for the second consecutive year, Waterford provided the opposition. In what many consider to be the greatest provincial decider of them all, both sides fought tooth-and-nail for the full seventy minutes. Unfortunately for McCarthy Cork lost the game by just a single point on a score line of Waterford 3-16, Cork 1-21. Although Cork surrendered their provincial crown they were still in with a chance of landing the All-Ireland title. After maneuvering through the qualifiers Cork reached a second consecutive All-Ireland final and, once again, Kilkenny provided the opposition. This game took on a life of its own for a number of reasons. Chief among these was the fact that Kilkenny were attempting to capture a third All-Ireland in-a-row and go one ahead of Cork in the All-Ireland roll of honour. The game was expected to be another classic; however, a damp day put an end to this. The first-half was a low-scoring affair and provided little excitement for fans. The second-half saw Cork completely take over. For the last twenty-three minutes Cork scored nine unanswered points and went on to win the game by 0-17 to 0-9. McCarthy was named man of the match while he also collected his first All-Ireland winners\' medal. He finished off the year by collecting an All-Star award.In 2005 Cork were on form again. They won back the provincial crown that year with a 1-12 to 1-16 victory over Tipperary. It was McCarthy\'s second Munster winners medal as Cork went on the march for glory once again. In the All-Ireland semi-final against Clare their championship campaign was nearly derailed when they fell behind by seven points at the start of the second-half. A huge performance by Cork turned this deficit around and Cork went on to win the game by 0-16 to 0-15. While it was expected that Cork and Kilkenny would do battle again in a third consecutive All-Ireland final Galway were the surprise winners of the second semi-final. It was the first meeting of Cork and Galway in an All-Ireland final since 1990 and even more daunting was the fact that men from the west had never beaten Cork in a championship decider. Once again neither side broke away into a considerable lead, however, at the final whistle Cork were ahead by 1-21 to 1-16. For the second year in-a-row Cork were the All-Ireland champions and McCartrhy collected his second winners medal.2006 saw Cork turn their attentions to a first three-in-a-row of All-Ireland titles since 1978. The teams championship campaign got off to a good start with a 0-20 to 0-14 defeat of Clare in the opening round of the Munster championship. The subsequent provincial decider saw Cork take on Tipp for the second consecutive year. Star forward Joe Deane was to the fore, scoring an impressive eight points and contributing greatly to Corks 2-11 to 1-11 victory over their old rivals and a third Munster medal for McCarthy. Subsequent victories over Limerick and Waterford saw Cork qualify for their fourth consecutive All-Ireland final and for the third time Kilkenny were the opponents. Like previous encounters neither side took a considerable lead, however, Kilkenny had a vital goal from Aidan Fogarty. Cork were in arrears coming into the final few minutes, however, Ben O\'Connor goaled for Cork. It was too little too late as the Cats denied the Rebels the three-in-a-row on a score line of 1-16 to 1-13.In 2007 Cork were out foe redemption, however, their championship ambitions were hampered from the beginning. The so-called Semplegate affair resulted in Sen g  hAilpn, Donal g Cusack and Diarmuid O\'Sullivan being suspended for a crucial Munster semi-final clash with Waterford. In spite of being without three of their best players Cork put up a good fight but only lost by a goal. After maneuvering through the qualifiers Cork reached the All-Ireland quarter-final. Once again Waterford provided the opposition as the game controversially ended in a draw  3-16 apiece. The replay was less exciting; however, it was still a good game as Waterford triumphed by 2-17 to 0-20.The activities of the Cork footballers and their reaction to the appointment of Teddy Holland as their new manager impacted greatly on the preparations of the Cork hurling team. The entire panel went on a sympathy strike and missed the opening games of the National League. In the end the Cork hurlers returned to duty, with their first championship game being a Munster semi-final with Tipperary. In the lead up to the game there was speculation as to the formation of the Cork team as it was believed that some of the old guard would be blending into the background. Cork lost to Tipp by six points and had to take their chances in the win-or-bust qualifiers. A goal by Joe Deane in their next outing helped Cork to limp over the finish line against Dublin. The teams overall performance was less than impressive in the 1-17 to 0-15 win. Corks next game saw Galway, a team regarded as one of the best in the country, provided the opposition. The first-half was a poor affair with Corks goalkeeper, Donal g Cusack, being sent off. In the second-half Cork took charge with Joe Deane giving a great display and scoring four crucial points from play to help his team to a 0-23 to 2-15 victory and a place in the All-Ireland quarter-final. Clare were the opposition on that occasion and, once again, Cork gave a poor first-half display. The second-half was a different story with Cork taking charge once again and securing a 2-19 to 2-17 victory. This win allowed Cork to advance to the All-Ireland semi-final where Kilkenny provided the opposition. It was the first time that these two teams met in the championship outside of an All-Ireland final. That game was an intriguing encounter; however, the Cats won the day by 1-23 to 0-17.Following the defeat by Kilkenny in 2008 manager Gerald McCarthy\'s two-year contract came to an end. He was later re-appointed for a further two-year term by the Cork County Board, in spite of the majority of the players not wanting him to stay on. The players on the 2008 panel refused to play or train under McCarthy. (see 2008-2009 Cork players strike). McCarthy accordingly began the 2009 National League campaign with a new squad, none of whom had been able to make the previous year\'s panel. After months of pressure McCarthy eventually stepped down as manager.Following the resolution to these difficulties Cork were defeated by Tipperary on a score line of 1-19 to 0-19 in the opening round of the Munster campaign. After a convincing win over Offaly, Cork\'s next game was a win-or-bust All-Ireland qualifier meeting with Galway. Cork faltered in the final ten minutes with McCarthy missing a golden goal opportunity that could have turned the game. In the end \'the Tribesmen\' knocked \'the Rebels\' out of the championship by 1-19 to 0-15.'),(8167741,'KE_family','KE family.The KE family is a medical name designated for a British family of Pakistani origin, about half of whom exhibit a severe speech disorder called developmental verbal dyspraxia. It is the first family with speech disorder to be investigated using genetic analyses, by which the speech impediment is discovered to be due to genetic mutation, and from which the gene FOXP2, often dubbed the language gene, was discovered. Their condition is also the first human speech and language disorder known to exhibit strict Mendelian inheritance.Brought to medical attention from their school children in the late 1980s, the case of KE family was taken up at the UCL Institute of Child Health in London in 1990. Initial report indicated genetic disorder. But a Canadian linguist Myrna Gopnik suspected that the genetic disorder was mainly on grammatical deficiency, which led to a controversial notion of grammar gene. Geneticists at the University of Oxford however discovered that the condition was purely genetic with complex physical and physiological effects, and in 1998, identified the actual gene, eventually named FOXP2. This discovery directly led to a broader knowledge on human evolution as the gene is directly implicated with the origin of language.Two family members, a boy and a girl, were featured in the National Geographic documentary film Human Ape.Medical investigations.KE family children attended Elizabeth Augur\'s special educational needs unit at Brentford primary school in west London. Towards the end of 1980s seven children of the family attended there. Augur began to learn that the family had a speech disorder for three generations. Of the 30 members, about half suffer from severe deficiency, some are affected mildly, and few are unaffected. Their face show rigidity at the lower half, and most cannot complete pronouncing a word. Many of them have severe stuttering and with limited vocabulary. In particular, they have difficulty with consonants, and omit them, such as boon for spoon, able for table, and bu for blue. Linguistic deficiency is also noted in written language both in reading and writing. They are characterized by lower nonverbal IQ.Augur convinced the family to undergo medical studies and approached geneticist Michael Baraitser, of the Institute of Child Health. With colleagues Marcus Prembey and Jane Hurst, they started taking blood samples for analyses in 1987. Their first report in 1990 shows that 16 family members were affected by severe abnormality, though their intelligence and hearing are normal, and that the condition was genetically inherited (autosomal dominant). Upon the news, BBC was preparing a documentary of the case in the scientific serial Antenna. By this time, a Canadian linguist from McGill University, Myrna Gopnik, was visiting her son in Oxford, and delivered an invited lecture at the university, where she noticed the flyer for the BBC programme. She contacted the medical geneticists, interviewed KE family members, and returned to Montreal. She was convinced that the genetic defect was largely centred on grammatical ability, and wrote letters to Nature in 1990. Her reports promulgated a notion of grammar gene and a controversial concept of grammar-specific disorder.Discovery of FOXP2 gene.Neuroscientist and language expert at the Institute of Child Health, Faraneh Vargha-Khadem, began to investigate teaming up with University of Oxford and University of Reading linguists. In 1995 they found, contrary to Gopnik\'s hypothesis, from comparison of 13 affected and 8 normal individuals that the genetic disorder was a complex impairment of not only linguistic ability, but also intellectual and anatomical features, thereby disproving the grammar gene notion. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) they found that some brain regions were underactive (compared to baseline levels) in the KE family members; and some were overactive, compared to the normal people. The underactive regions included motor neurons that control face and mouth regions. The areas that were overactive includes Broca\'s area, the speech centre. With Oxford geneticists Simon Fisher and Anthony Monaco, they identified the exact location of the gene on the long arm of chromosome 7 (7q31) in 1998. The chromosomal region (locus) was named SPCH1 (for speech-and-language-disorder-1), and it contains 70 genes. Using the known gene location of speech disorder from a boy, designated CS, of unrelated family, they discovered in 2001 that the main gene responsible for speech impediment in both KE family and CS was FOXP2, and that this gene plays a major role in the origin and development of language. Mutations in the genes result in speech and language problems.'),(15923521,'Darney','Darney.Darney is a commune in the Vosges department in Lorraine in northeastern France.It is located in the Vge Plateau, around the location of the source of the river Sane. Darney is known for its forest of oak and beech trees.History.Darney is built on a promontory dominating the valley of the Sane. The Romans built a castle here to control the area, and watch the forested countryside. As a fortified town in the Middle Ages, Darney had towers and two fortified gates, and was known as the city of thirty towers. Theobald II, Duke of Lorraine gave the town its church in 1308. The town suffered during the Thirty years war, being razed by the Swedes led by Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, who were allies of the French, in 1634. The castle of the time was destroyed in 1639. Remnants of this castle still exist, as well as the current, smaller castle, which was built in 1725.During the First World War, Darney was the rallying point for Czech and Slovak volunteers, where they were stationed at Camp Kleber. Due to their presence, on 30 June 1918, Czechoslovakian independence was proclaimed in the village. The French President, Raymond Poincar inspected 6,000 Czech and Slovak legionnaires, before handing over the Czechoslovakian army flag to Edvard Bene, Minister of the Interior and of Foreign Affairs within the Provisional Czechoslovak government. This flag became the flag of the 21st rifle regiment.The former town hall is now a Franco-Czechoslovakian museum, dedicated to Camp Kleber, the Czechoslovakian troops stationed there, and the birth of the Czechoslovakian state.Twin towns.Darney is twinned with the town of Slavkov u Brna, also known as Austerlitz, in Moravia.Points of interest.Exceptional Darney forest and wilderness assets of Ourche Valley: Oak trees, roe deers, red deers, wild cats.

The Pomeranian Philharmonic is the musical center of Kujawy-Pomerania Province and also features an outdoor art gallery.Location.The seat of the Pomeranian Philharmonic is located in downtown Bydgoszcz, in the center of the Music District. It is surrounded by Jan Kochanowski Park, music schools, and an outdoor gallery of sculptures of composers and virtuoso musicians.Characteristics.The Pomeranian Philharmonic is a cultural institution whose bodies are under the authority of leading Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage and Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship. Performances include symphonic concerts, chamber music, and recitals by virtuosos from all over the world. On stage Philarmonic concerts are accompanied by Polish or foreign groups, to play at the occasion of jubilees, commemorations and congresses organized by universities and private companies. The repertoire includes music of all periods, from medieval to contemporary works.The acoustics of the concert hall of the Pomeranian Philharmonic is famous for its quality: concert recordings of classical and contemporary music are often performaed there.In 2010, the Pomeranian Philharmonic has carried out in their hall 360 concerts, gathering an audience of 79200 people.The first director of the Pomeranian Philarmonic was, from 1953 to 1991, Andrzej Szwalbe, who made the orchestra of Bydgoszcz a recognized scene in Europe. Since 1991, director is Eleonora Harendarska.Municipal Symphony Orchestra.In January 1936, on the initiative of voluntary musicians, the Bydgoszcz symphony orchestra has been created, soon directed by Wilhelm von Winterfeld. The inaugural concert of the Municipal Symphony Orchestra has been held on May 8, 1936 Strzelnicy Hall in Toruska street. The following year year, the orchestra was led by Alfons Rezler, a professor of the Municipal Conservatoire of Music, providing the basis for its organization. In 1938, the Bydgoszcz\'s Music Society took over the patronage of the orchestra, and the Municipality provided a considerable assistance to the team. World War II and the years of occupation have destroyed theses achievements: Alfons Rezler died during the invasion of Poland, many musicians were killed or fled abroad.Pomeranian Symphony Orchestra.In 1946, to celebrate the 600th anniversary of the foundation of Bydgoszcz, a new formation, close to the pre-war Symphony Orchestra of the Music Society of Bydgoszcz was created by Arnold Rezler, Jerzy Jasieski, Felicja Krysiewicz and chaired by Witold Miller. It gave its first concert on May 12, 1946, in the hall of the Pomorski House of Arts in Gdaska Street. From 1946 to 1949, the Music society of Bydgoszcz set up the foundations of the organisation and the material, with few interference of the city. During this period the orchestra was called Pomeranian Symphony Orchestra of the Bydgoszcz Music Society.Public concerts were held four times a month, with additional ones in schools of Bydgoszcz and of the Voivodeship. Already at that time, initiatives to invite eminent conductors (Witold Rowicki and Bohdan Wodiczko) and soloists started (Stanisaw Szpinalski, Zbigniew Drzewiecki, Regina Smendzianka, Kazimierz Wikomirski, Wanda Wikomirska). Conducting Orchestra, among others.In 1949, Mieczyslaw Tomaszewski was nominated as new director: he organized three series of concerts related to Frdric Chopin (for the centenary of the composer\'s death), and presented a series of concerts Music for All in 26 cities of the Voivodeship. The orchestra was nationalized in November 1950.On September 1, 1951, Andrew Szwalbe became director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic Orchestra. He soon championed the project of the construction of a specific building for the Philharmonic, to move out of the Pomorski House of Arts in Gdaska Street. Main conductors at this time were, among others Edward Bury, Tadeusz Wilczak or Robert Satanowski. The inaugural concert of the new symphony orchestra of the State Pomeranian Philharmonic took place on January 9, 1953, in the hall of the Polish Theatre.In September 1955, the orchestra of the National Pomeranian Philharmonic, numbering 65 musicians, was augmented by disbanded musicians from the Bydgoszcz Polish Radio Orchestra. In the same year the name of the institution was changed to Ignacy Jan Paderewski Pomeranian Philharmonic, earning the esteem of more and more talented graduates of music schools. In 1971, the philarmonic counted more than 100 people. Many of the orchestra musicians began working in music schools of Bydgoszcz and Torun.On November 15, 1958, the orchestra performed its first concert in the brand new building of the Pomeranian Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz.Pomeranian Philharmonic.On September 1951, Andrzej Szwalbe has been appointed director of the Pomeranian Philharmonic Orchestra, which was nationalized in December 1952: on January 1, 1953, the orchestra was renamed National Pomeranian Philharmonic in Bydgoszcz. Already in February 1953, attempts to have a new philharmonic concert hall have been made, and thanks to the efforts of the Social Committee for the Philharmonic Building, on June 26, 1954 the ceremony laying the foundation stone of the edifice at Libelta street 16 happened. The construction was completed in autumn 1958: the new building was spacious, had a convenient location, and most of all have a concert hall with rare acoustic conditions. On November 16, 1958 a gala concert marking the opening of the new building was held, led by Zbigniew Chwedczuk. During the following days an occasional music festival took place, with concerts were in Bydgoszcz, Torun and Wocawek. At the same time, the Philharmonic was christened Ignacy Jan Paderewski, whose half-brother Jzef lived in Bydgoszcz from 1926 until his death in 1958.Thanks to Andrzej Szwalbe\'s work, 1961 was the year of the first musical event on a national scale, the Ignacy Jan Paderewski International Piano competition (Midzynarodowy Konkurs Pianistyczny im. Ignacego Jana Paderewskiego). Since then, each year is organized a Bydgoszcz Music Festival.The exceptional acoustic of the concert hall drew to Bydgoszcz best artists from all around the world, among others, Witold Macuyski (1959), Arthur Rubinstein (1960), David Oistrakh (1961), Benjamin Britten (1961), Sviatoslav Richter (1963), Arthur Moreira Lima (1965), Bernard Ringeissen (1965), Ruggiero Ricci (1969), Garrick Ohlsson (1973), Grigori Zhislin (1977), Eugen Indjic, Vadim Brodsky, Stanislav Bunin (1986), Halina Czerny-Stefaska, Maurizio Pollini, Wanda Wikomirska, Teresa ylis-Gara, Krystian Zimerman, Konstanty Andrzej Kulka, George Byrd, Shlomo Mintz, Mischa Maisky, Kevin Kenner, Kurt Masur, Kazimierz Kord, Jerzy Maksymiuk, Antoni Wit.

In 1966, Andrej Szwalbe organized, in cooperation with the Bydgoszcz Scientific Society and the Department of Musicology of the University of Warsaw, the first festival of ancient music Musica Antiqua Europae Orientalis. Happening every three years, it is now a well-known event in the worldwide musical life. From 1963 to 1967, the Pomeranian Philharmonic hosted the Festival of Polish Music, later revamped into Bydgoszcz Music Festival.As a homage to his major contributions to the development of the Philharmonic and his outstanding cultural role, brought her longtime manager, Andrej Szwalbe has been nominated Honorary Citizen of Bydgoszcz. Another of his realizations is the inception of the music district, surrounding the building of the Philharmonic Music and comprising the Academy of Music Feliks Nowowiejski and the sculpture gallery of composers and virtuosos. On the front square the Philharmonic has been built in the 1970s an organ-shaped fountain.Inside, the lobby is decorated with a collection of tapestries. Interiors are adorned with a collection of portraits and busts of prominent composers and an exhibition of historic pianos, as well as rich music library.History.Construction began in February 1954, under the supervision of Zbigniew Arciszewski from Gdansk University of Technology. The construction was financed by the Social Reconstruction Fund of the Capital. The building site was twice inspected by a delegation of Soviet builders from Warsaw\'s Palace of Culture and Science in September 1954 and January 1955. The building was erected using Polish building materials, with the help of Polish engineering and manpower. The interior decor was designed by a team of artists from Torun-Stefan Zarbski, Joseph Kozlowski and Jozef Kowalczyk-, wood panelling prepared by Bydgoszcs\'s Furniture Factory, railings by Blacksmith craftmen from Gdask and chandelier by Szklarska Porba glassworks which provided chandeliers for Warsaw Palace of Culture and Science.acoustics were able to reach excellence. There is nothing to be ashamed of with regards to the East or the West [...] Architecture.The building is a 18m high regular structure with dimensions of 35m by 45m, reminding willingly the features of the Warsaw Phiharmonic building rebuilt at the same period (1955). The main elevation is mounted on a pedestal. The central part of the frontage displays a two-storey high colonnade, joined at its bottom by baluster railings. Facades are topped with attic style cornices with wire mesh walls. Terraces are available between each facade colonnades.Early in the 1950s, live broadcast occurred thanks to Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship radio resources, airing both intimate recordings, as well as great symphony orchestra concerts with a choir, with up to 300 people. Around the buildings are displayed sculptures, part of the outdoor monument gallery.Acoustics.The main concert hall of the Pomeranian Philharmonic is classified as acoustically one of the best in Europe, as confirmed by well-known artists and music critics. In the background of the main concert hall is set up a mechanical organ produced by the firm Riger-Kloss from Krnov (Czech Republic). The chamber hall is equipped with an organ made by the establishment of Stefan Truszczyski from Wocawek. There is also a large collection of concert keyboards, pianos and harpsichords.Its excellent acoustics gives to the Pomeranian Philharmonic a fame among well-known artists, being regularly the site of professional recording for music publishers. In this location has been realised Poland\'s first 24-karat gold audio Compact Disc.Interior.The Pomeranian Philharmonic has a large collection of art works that are exhibited in the lobby and halls: sculptures, paintings and graphic/textile art works.Adam Myjak, Kazimierz Gustaw Zema, Barbara Zbroyna, Marian Konieczny, Alfons Karny, Ryszard Wojciechowski or Micha Kubiak.

Part of the collection adorned the Polish pavilion at the Seville Expo \'92 World\'s fair.Collections.The Piano Collection of the Pomeranian Philharmonic comprises 54 instruments. These are historical instruments, mainly from the 19th century: pianos, clavichords, player pianos and harmonichords coming from Paris, Berlin, Leipzig, St. Petersburg, London, Vienna, Cologne, Riga, Stuttgart, Warsaw, Krakow, Gdask, Wrocaw, Kalisz and Bydgoszcz. Purchases of these instruments began in 1970, under the direction of Andrzej Szwalbe. The first instrument was apiano winger, from Kaliningrad firm Gebauhr (ca 1875). The oldest exhibit is a table piano for children, produced by Vienna company Nurnberg Amberberga (ca 1800). One of the instrument of 1890 has been donated by composer Zygmunt Noskowski. Other exhibits worth mentioning are: a Parisian harmonichord, an English player piano, table pianos playing a record of Janczarski (drums and bells), pianos from Bydgoszcz factory Bruno Sommerfeld located from 1905 to 1945 in Dworcowa Street. In 1985, pianos were moved to Ostromecko Palace, but due to renovation, they were stored in warehouses. In 1999 a concept exhibition have been realized in the musical instruments museum in Bydgoszcz.The collection in Ostromecko Palace is now reopened as The Andrzej Szwalbe Collection.The Harpsichord Collection has been established in 1976, by director Andrzej Szwalbe who was inspired by the activity of the band Capella Bydgostiensis specialized in playing on Early music instruments. In the 1970s, four harpsichords, replicas of 16th-18th centuries French and Flemish historical instruments, were brought from United States. In the 1980s harpsichordists from across Poland played on these instruments, documenting their recording with the Polskie Radio. Later on, Bydgoszcz collection ushered in a new era for the executive practice of harpsichord in Poland.Sculpture gallery.The Sculpture gallery of composers and virtuosos consists of busts and monuments located in the interiors and surroundings of the Pomeranian Philharmonic building.History.This gallery has been created with the initiative of Andrzej Szwalbe, the longtime manager of the Pomeranian Philharmonic.The nature and objectives of the whole gallery were designed by Andrew Szwalbe. In the course of several years he held the unveiling of monuments with participation of the living artists in the halls and corridors of the Pomeranian Philharmonic, generally associated with special concerts.Gallery is a review of Polish sculpture from the late 1950s to the 1990s: each work reveals specific characteristics of its sculptor and the original psychological approach of each character.Outdoor gallery.The area around the Pomeranian Philharmonic building is called the Music District. Jan Kochanowski Park features 15 monuments (10 statues and 5 busts) of composers and virtuoso musicians.

It caters for pupils aged from 11 to 16 years. It is also a specialist Arts College.The school.Castle High School is one of the most recently formed schools in the Dudley area, although its buildings are some of the oldest. It was formed in September 1989 on a merger between The Dudley School and The Blue Coat School, and gave education for pupils aged from 12 to 18 years. It also took in some of the pupils from the closing Sir Gilbert Claughton School. The Dudley School had been established in 1975 by the merger of the selective highly regarded Dudley Grammar School and Dudley Girls High School, \'The Old Dudleians\' of The Grammar School for boys at St James\'s Road making way for the establishment of \'The Dudleians\', for former students of Dudley Grammar School and Dudley Girls High School in 2005 with the organisation of the first official joint reunion for 30 years.The Castle High School name was chosen in a poll by the Dudley School pupils, who also chose the design of the new school\'s logo.There had been talk of a merger between the Dudley School and at least one of the other smaller secondary schools in Dudley since 1985 (which would have formed a school called The Ednam School), but the merger between Dudley School and Blue Coat was not confirmed until October 1988. The new school\'s name was confirmed the following spring.After a year, the school opened to 11-year-olds following the local authority\'s decision to reduce the primary school leaving age; at the same time, the sixth form centre was closed and the leaving age for pupils fell to 16. The former sixth form facilities were used as classrooms to accommodate the new younger pupils.September 1990 also saw the school take in approximately 50% of pupils from Mons Hill School, which closed due to falling pupil numbers. Several teachers at these schools were also recruited to Castle High School.Unlike the Blue Coat School, however, Castle High School never used the Mons Hill buildings as these were taken over by Dudley College.For the first year of its existence, Castle High School also incorporated the Blue Coat School buildings on Kates Hill where the final two academic year groups of that school\'s pupils remained for a year. Sir Gilbert Claughton School (formerly the Sir Gilbert Claughton Grammar Technical School), however, remained a separate school as the final year of that school\'s pupils completed their education.A new three-storey classroom block was opened in the 1991 summer term, the first in several phases of expansion which were completed in 1995. The expansion also saw the demolition of the school swimming pool which had been in the Dudley Grammar School buildings. Mobile classrooms were on the site until the permanent buildings were opened.The expanded Castle High School was officially opened on 20 October 1995 by George Carey, Archbishop of Canterbury.Castle High School is situated in St James\'s Road, near Dudley town centre, mostly within the buildings of the former Dudley Grammar School (which date back to 1897, the original school being established in 1562). An extension was completed in 1995 and the adjoining buildings in Priory Road (formerly Dudley Girls High School) were demolished at the beginning of the following year.The school\'s current head teacher is Ms Michelle King. The previous headteacher was Mr Trevor Johnson, and for the first 13 years of the school\'s existence the head teacher was Mr Geoff Cresswell.Plans were unveiled in June 2008 for Castle High School to receive Academy status, sponsored by the Oasis Community Learning Trust, possibly in time for the 2009/2010 academic year. However, these plans were thrown into doubt five months later due to doubts over the availability of adequate funding. In March 2009, it was confirmed the academy plans would not go ahead.28% of the pupils leaving Castle High School in summer 2009 gained 5 or more GCSEs at grade C or above, making it the second lowest ranking secondary school in the borough, despite high pass rates (A-C GCSE) in previous years.The school is set for a new board of governors and a new head teacher with effect from September 2010, along with a 650,000 refurbishment of the older school buildings.Fatality.The school suffered a tragedy in February 2001 when 12-year-old pupil Scott Holloway died after being knocked down by a van near his home on the Priory Estate. Staff and pupils at Castle High set up a fund in Scott\'s memory and a total of almost 1,100 was raised for the fund, some of which was raised by bidding for a signed Aston Villa football. A local van driver later received a fine and a driving ban for careless driving in connection to Scott\'s death..'),(28533132,'Emmanuel_Rodr%C3%ADguez','Emmanuel Rodrguez.Emmanuel Manny Rodrguez (born August 8, 1992) is a Puerto Rican professional boxer in the bantamweight division. While still a youth, he was incorporated into Puerto Rico\'s national team, competing in multiple open-class tournaments, including the Pan-American Championships, where he advanced to the finals. He finished second at the 2010 Youth World Amateur Boxing Championships, becoming the second consecutive Puerto Rican to win a medal in the flyweight division. Rodrguez was Puerto Rico\'s flag-bearer at the inaugural Youth Olympic Games and became the first flyweight champion in the event\'s history.Early life.Rodrguez is originally from Urbanizacin Villa Real near Ojo de Agua, a middle class urban sector of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico. His parents are Awilda Vzquez Soler and Luis Rodrguez. Throughout his childhood he practiced other sports before choosing boxing, including one of Puerto Rico\'s most widespread team sports, baseball. Rodrguez also served as forward of the local association football team, Invasores de Vega Baja. He studied at a local school named Escuela Lino Padrn Rivera until tenth grade. Due to his skill, he was subsequently enrolled at the Escuela Especializada en Deportes del Albergue Olmpico (ECEDAO), a specialized school run by the Comit Olmpico de Puerto Rico (COPUR) that provides education, residence, training and facilities to practice specific Olympic sports. On May 27, 2011, Rodrguez graduated as part of the program.Early international competition and Youth Olympic championship.By 2006, Rodrguez was already competing at a national Youth level, participating in the Juegos Nacionales Escolares 2006, where he defeated Emmanuel Ramrez of Arecibo (2:1) in the 1314 years (41kg) division. As an amateur, his corner team is led by Arturo Ros and Orlando Rodrguez Zayas, who trained Puerto Rico\'s previous Olympic medalist, Daniel Santos. Despite still being ranked in the Youth category, Rodrguez entered the light flyweight open-class at the 2009 Pan-American Championships when he was 17 years old. He won his debut over Mexican National Light Flyweight Champion, Francisco Melndez, by unanimous points decision (10:3). In the semifinals, he fought Cuban National Light Flyweight Subchampion, Daniel Matelln, winning a close fight by one point (11:10). In the finals, Rodrguez lost another close fight to Paulo Carvalho of Brasil, 12:9, to secure the silver medal. He had previously entered the 2009 Torneo Nacional de Boxeo Aficionado Isaac Barrientos, Puerto Rico\'s senior national championships, advancing to the semifinals before losing to Waldemar Pagn (12:9). Between May 19 through 23, Rodrguez participated in the 2009 Torneo Internacional Jos Cheo Aponte, another open-class international tournament. In the semifinals he fought Bryan Aquino, who had defeated Pagn for Puerto Rico\'s National Light Flyweight Championship, winning by points (19:5). In the finals, he was matched against Waldemar Rodrguez, defeating him by Referee Stopping Contest (RSC) in two rounds to win the gold medal. On July 5, 2009, Rodrguez competed in the finals of the Copa Olmpica Juan Evangelista Venegas, an annual tournament held by the COPUR, defeating ngel Acosta by RSC in two rounds.After ascending to the flyweight division, Rodrguez participated in the Copa Internacional de Boxeo Aficionado San Juan Bautista, a boxing dual where foreign golden gloves winners were invited. He was expected to compete in the 2010 Torneo Nacional de Boxeo Aficionado Isaac Barrientos, but he was unable to attend, awarding a walkover victory to his scheduled opponent, Jess Soler. His next international participation was at the 2010 American Continental Elite Men Championships. Rodrguez competed twice, defeating Mexican National Flyweight Champion, Elas Emigdio, (8:6) and fellow Puerto Rican Jos Nez (4:0). At the 2010 Youth World Amateur Boxing Championships which were held in Baku, Azerbaijan, he debuted with a RSC victory over Lassana Camara of Mali, after receiving a bye in the first date of eliminatories. In the round of 16, Rodrguez defeated Pahlavon Hojiyev of Uzbekistan, 6:4. He advanced to the semifinals with an 8:1 win over Min Hong of South Korea. His next opponent was Hesham Yehia Mahmoud Abdelaal of Egypt, whom he defeated with scores of 10:3. At the finals, he lost a 6:14 decision to local Shaban Shahpalangov. By winning the silver medal, Rodrguez became the second consecutive Puerto Rican to win recognition in the flyweight division at the Youth World Championships and secured participation in the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics.After the World Championships, Rodrguez entered the Copa Olmpica Juan Evangelista Venegas 2010. In his debut, he defeated Eddie Valenzuela of Guatemala by points (11:2). In the finals he was matched against his predecessor, 2008 AIBA Youth World Champion and senior Puerto Rico National Flyweight Champion, Jonathan Gonzlez. Rodrguez used a defensive strategy, while Gonzlez was the aggressor. Employing his counter punching, he was able to gain an advantage of 3 points, while Gonzlez focused on punches to the body, that are generally not scored under AIBA regulation. Rodrguez closed the contest ahead 4:1, winning the first encounter between Puerto Rico\'s most recent Youth medalists. Despite this result, Gonzlez was selected to be part of the national team assembled for the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games. This was due to recommendations made by the amateur boxing federation and High Performance Department, who wanted Rodrguez to have an uninterrupted preparation for the upcoming event. He was selected to be Puerto Rico\'s Olympic flag-bearer at the Youth Olympic Games, receiving the flag from David Bernier, president of the COPUR. In his debut, Rodrguez defeated Vasily Vetkin of Russia by points, finishing with scores of 11:4 after an even start. In the semifinals, he fought in a rematch against Abdelaal. Rodrguez was ahead in the scores throughout the fight, finishing the first round ahead 3:0, scoring two more points in the second and six in the third. Abdelaal was only able to score once during the second round, for a final score of 11:1. The other boxer to advance was DJ Maaki of Nauru. Rodrguez opened the final fight ahead 9:1 after the first round, scoring thrice in the second and thrice in the third before the referee stopped the contest in his favor at the 1:34 mark. This was Puerto Rico\'s first Olympic gold medal, the fact that it was won by a boxer in the national team\'s first participation in the competition mimics the feat accomplished by Juan Evangelista Venegas, who won bronze in the delegation\'s debut at the 1948 Summer Olympics. Rodrguez returned to the archipelago five days later, receiving recognitions from the COPUR and municipal government of Vega Baja for his performance. Subsequently, a request for inclusion in the High Performance Full-Time Athlete Program was sent to the government, citing an exception to the standard rule, which was drafted to include medalists at the Pan American Games, World Championships or senior Olympics.Immolation and recovery.On November 12, 2010, Rodrguez was involved in an incident where a pickup truck was partially damaged. He and a companion were burned, being initially attended at a hospital in Vega Baja, before both were transferred to the specialized burn care unit of Centro Mdico in San Juan, where he was placed in preventive intubation to ease the stress on his lungs. Rodrguez suffered second degree burns in approximately 66% of his body, most of the damage focusing in his back and legs. Due to the incident, Rodrguez was removed from a scheduled dual, but was kept among the recipients of a grant issued by the COPUR. By late December he was already training two to three days per week, while admitted in the burn unit and still wearing bandages around one of his arms and both legs. His trainer, Orlando Rodrguez, noted that this was the first time that he worked with a pugilist while still recovering in a hospital. Consequently, a special regime was prepared to work on his footwork, speed and strength, while including other standard practices such as shadow boxing and pads. In his first interview since the incident, Rodrguez noted that he intended to focus on his career and education from that point onwards, severing ties with any negative influence. The following week, the possibility of infection was dismissed by the medical personnel, who allowed more contact with external items, including haircutting tools. Upon being released, the original plan was to participate in the qualification of the 2011 Pan American Games, but he received a negative report from Enrique Amy, chief doctor of the COPUR\'s Anti-Doping Commission. The amateur boxing federation followed the recommendation. Consequently, Rodrguez spent several months of additional recovery, focused on treatment to avoid re-injuring or infecting the scar tissue in his left arm.Return and Olympic qualification events.On September 14, 2011, Rodrguez made his official in-ring return at the V Copa ngel Cholo Espada, competing within the super flyweight division. He went on to dominate the tournament, winning his first two contests following the incident with scores of 12:2 and RSC-3. On December 17, 2011, Rodrguez won the flyweight senior national championship, defeating Juan Carlos Lpez in the tournament finals, 19:3. He had previously advanced over Michael del Valle (18:4) in the semifinals. Rodrguez entered the 2012 Torneo de Boxeo Aficionado Isaac Barrientos, which was a qualifier for the Olympic national boxing team. He advanced to the semifinals, but lost to 17-year-old Jeyvier Cintrn by a single point, mirroring his own ascension over Gonzlez. Rodrguez then entered the Copa Independencia in the Dominican Republic, but lost his fight against Eddie Valenzuela due to injury (RSCI) in the third round. In this tournament Cintrn went on to win the bronce medal. A rematch took place on April 7, 2012, in which Cintrn defeated Rodrguez with a largest margin of 10:3. Unable to complete the Olympic cycle, he decided to close his amateur career and enter the professional ranks. Rodrguez trained for two months to transition and abjust to the difference in styles.Professional career.Rodrguez made his debut on June 1, 2012, in the undercard of a Puerto Rico Best Boxing event, in which he defeated Jason Agosto by knockout in the first round. In his second appearance, he defeated Jaime Gonzlez by technical knockout in two rounds. Rodrguez continued performing in the undercard of other boxers, earning consecutive knockouts over Luis Ortiz and Jos Ruiz. His first decision win was over Ramn Emilio Cedao, in a fight that was contested in the bantamweight limit of 118 pounds. In a card held at the Dominican Republic, Rodrguez countered the aggression of Edward Vargas to score a third round technical knockout. Competing in the undercard of Jos Pedraza\'s homecoming event, he defeated Felipe Rivas by unanimous decision. On December 21, 2013, Rodrguez won a unanimous decision over former world contender David Quijano, employing his technique throughout eight rounds.'),(46008650,'James_de_Audley','James de Audley.James de Audley (1220  1272), or James de Aldithel and Alditheley, was an English baron.Biography.Audley was born in 1220 to Henry de Audley, and was, like him, a lord-marcher. In 1257 he accompanied Richard, king of the Romans, to his coronation at Aachen (Matt. Paris), sailing on 29 April (Rymer) and returning to England in the autumn to take part in the Welsh campaign (1257-1260). In the following year (1258) he was one of the royalist members of the council of fifteen nominated by the Provisions of Oxford, and witnessed, as \'James of Aldithel,\' their confirmation by the king (18 Oct.). He also, with his brother-in-law, Peter de Montfort, was appointed commissioner to treat with Llewelyn (18 Aug.), and two years later he acted as an itinerant justice. On Llewelyn of Wales attacking Mortimer, a royalist marcher, Audley joined Prince Edward at Hereford, 9 January 1263 to resist the invasion. But the barons, coming to Llewelyn\'s assistance, dispersed the royalist forces, and seized on his castles and estates. He is wrongly said by Dugdale and Foss to have been made \'justice of Ireland\' in this year, but in December he was one of the royalist sureties in the appeal to Louis of France. At the time of the battle of Lewes (May 1264) he was in arms for the king on the Welsh marches (Matthew Paris), and he was one of the first to rise against the government of Simon de Montfort. On Gloucester embracing the royal cause, early in 1265, Audley joined him with the other marchers, and took part in the campaign of Evesham and the overthrow of the baronial party. He appears to have gone on a pilgrimage to Galicia in 1268, and also, it is stated, to Palestine in 1270; but though his name occurs among the \'Crucesignati\' of 21 May 1270, it is clear that he never went, for he was appointed justiciary of Ireland a few months later, his name first occurring in connection with that office 5 September 1270. He also served as High Sheriff of Staffordshire and Shropshire in 1261 and 1270. During his tenure as Justiciar of Ireland he led several expeditions against \'the Irish rebels,\' but died by \'breaking his neck\' about 11 June 1272 (when he is last mentioned as justiciary), and was succeeded by his son James, who did homage 29 July 1272.'),(30650709,'Pierre_Rolland_(musician)','Pierre Rolland (musician).Pierre Rolland (13 October 1931 - 29 November 2011) was a Canadian oboist, english horn player, radio broadcaster, music critic, music educator, and arts administrator.

It was sited in front of the Stadtschloss, both structures were demolished by the GDR in 1950. The planned Monument to Freedom and Unity is to be located on the base originally constructed for the monument. The monument was an equestrian statue of the first German Emperor Wilhelm I, on the Spree Canal along the Eosander portal on the west side of the Berlin City Palace. The design of the memorial was directly influenced by Wilhelm I\'s grandson, Kaiser Wilhelm II, and the neo-baroque style of the memorial is the main work of sculptor Reinhold Begas, who had also designed the Victory Boulevard and the Bismarck National Memorial which was originally placed in front of the Reichstag building.Competitions and the intervention of the Emperor.After the death of Wilhelm I in the Year of Three Emperors (1888) an open competition for the establishment of a central national monument to his memory was tendered the next year. The first competition, in which the architect Bruno Schmitz with the draft Imperial Forum was chosen, did not bring the desired results. So in 1891 a second, limited bid to only eight selected artists was tendered. The location of the monument was laid down on the west side of the City Palace, along the Spree Canal. The design of Reinhold Begas and Gustav Halmhuber was eventually chosen.When it became known that the Emperor desired to have one of his favorite artists, Reinhold Begas, added to the list of the original eight artists invited to submit designs for the second competition, four of those artists withdrew. As might be expected, Begas won the competition and contracted sculptor Wilhelm von Rmann and his students to assist with creating the statues for his memorial design. The architectural part of the design was devised by the Stuttgart architect Gustav Halmhuber, who won the competition with his collaborator Begas, even against the design submitted by favored court architect Ernst von Ihne.In June 1894, construction began with the demolition of the houses that lined the street between the canal and Eosander Portal of the City Palace. On August 18, 1895, the 25th anniversary of the Battle of Gravelotte, the foundation stone for the memorial was laid. During the ten-day centennial celebrations held on the 100th anniversary of Wilhelm I birth, the monument was debuted on the late Emperor\'s birthday, 22 March 1897. The construction cost was four million marks, and represented a considerable sum when compared with the soon to be built Old Town Hall, which cost seven million marks to construct. The monument was also controversial due to its monumental size and the neo-baroque design.Description of the memorial design.The central point of the 21 meter high monument was the 9 meter high equestrian statue of the Emperor, to the left accompanied bya female representation of Peace holding the reins of his horse. The orientation of the equestrian statue was directly facing the Eosander portal (Portal III), which was the main entrance of the City Palace. This followed a similar pattern of statues around the palace, such as the monument of the Great Elector on the Elector Bridge which was aligned to the palace\'s Portal I; and the monument to Wilhelm I\'s father, King Frederick William III in the Lustgarten, which was aligned with the palace\'s Portal IV.Around the equestrian statue\'s bronze pedestal, at the corners floated four Goddesses of Victory on balls. The front the pedestal bore the inscription William the Great, German Emperor, King of Prussia 1861-1888 and on the back was the inscription in gratitude and true love, the German people. On the granite steps of the substructure on the north was a colossal statue of War and to the south one of Peace, created by Eugen Boermel. On the four projecting corners guarded four lion statues. From the north, the rear part of the monument was the Spree Canal. There is a still preserved today the jetty, which was used for barges on the canal. Except for some ventilation shafts are no other entrances from the jetty to the vault under-structure of the monument.The design was mockingly known by the nicknamed Wilhelm in the lions\' den. This alluded to the compositional appealof the central figure in a semicircle, which was similar to Briton Rivire recent painting Daniel\'s Answer to the King.The entire memorial complex stood on a raised base of polished red granite from Sweden. This raised platform was nine steps up from the sidewalk and was suitable for national celebrations of all kindsCity Palace and the National Monument in 1900The equestrian statue was enclosed on three sides facing away from the palace by a sandstone hall formed by coupled Ionic columns,which were enclosed at the ends by two corner pavilions. To emphasize the terraced rise of the square even more, the hall was increased in height by four meters. In the open and light design of the hall, only the corner pavilions were formed in a massive style. This allowed a good view on all sides of the equestrian statue and the palace beyond. The floor of the hall was covered by a sandstone mosaic floor.On the ledge of the front four groups of figures embodied the Kingdoms of Prussia (by Peter Breuer), Bavaria (by August Gaul), Saxony (by August Kraus) and Wrttemberg (by Peter Christian Breuer). The four groups on the back against the Spree represented trade and shipping (by Ludwig Cauer), art (by Hermann Hidding), science (by Karl Bega) and agriculture and industriousness (by Ludwig Cauer). The southern corner pavilion was crowned by the bronze quadriga of Bavaria, the work of Carl Hans Bernewitz. The counterpart on the northern corner pavilion, the four horse quadriga representing Borussia, created by John Goetz.History until removal.During the November Revolution of 1918, the monument was damaged in parts. During the early days of the Weimar Republic the government decided to restore the monument instead of removing it. The monument came through The Second World War relatively undamaged. In the winter of 1949/50, the GDR\'s ruling party, the SED decided to demolish the monument to its base. The demolition was politically motivated, as was the case a short time later with the decision to demolish the City Palace. The base still exists today on the southwestern edge of the castle square and is a listed building. The base floor is partiallydecorated with mosaics that are now protected under a layer of asphalt from the elements.In the underground vaults of the pedestal, street artists are known to leave their works, which can be visited at irregular intervals at one\'s own risk on descending a steep ladder into a revision shaft.From the actual monument, there exist two lions groups (two figures), which have been placed before the lion house at the Berlin Zoo.

It may typically consist of an input joystick, a mechanism for reducing the range of movement and an output section with the means of holding a microtool to hold, inject, cut or otherwise manipulate the object as required. The mechanism for reducing the movement usually requires the movement to be free of backlash. This is achieved by the use of kinematic constraints to allow each part of the mechanism to move only in one or more chosen degrees of freedom, which achieves a high precision and repeatability of movement, usually at the expense of some absolute accuracy.Movement.Movement reduction can be performed by mechanical levers, hydraulically using pistons of different diameters connected by tubing containing non-compressible fluid, electronically using stepper motors or linear actuators, or combinations of techniques in one instrument. Mechanisms with different ranges of movement or variable reduction ratio may be incorporated in one instrument to allow coarse and fine positioning.Microscope integration.Micromanipulators are usually used in conjunction with microscopes. Depending on the application, one or more micromanipulators may be fitted to a microscope stage or rigidly mounted to a bench next to a microscope. A typical application of micromanipulation is human intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Here, a spermatozoon measuring some 3 to 5 micrometres across is injected into an oocyte of approximately 100 micrometres in diameter, under the direct manual control of an embryologist. A disposable glass micropipette is fitted to a toolholder mounted on the output of the manipulator.

This constitutes part of the daily exercise regime needed to keep a dog healthy. It also provides exercise and companionship for the walker.Description.In the UK, The Kennel Club conducted a survey of 1,000 dog owners and found that one in five did not walk their dogs on a daily basis.Dogs are walked with a collar around their neck, or a dog harness, or by following their owner by familiarity and verbal control. Commonly the dog is walked by the owner, or another family member, but there are also professional dog walkers.Health benefits.A study by Michigan State University showed that people who walk their dogs are 34% more likely to meet expected levels of exercise, with a recommended level of 150 minutes of activity such as dog walking per week. Matthew Reeves, the co-author of the study said, There is no magic bullet in getting people to reach those benchmarks but walking a dog has a measurable impact.Professional dog walkers.Professional dog walkers, both individuals and businesses, are paid by dog owners to walk their dogs for them. Some dog walkers will take many dogs for a walk at once, while others will not. Also growing in popularity is dog running. Dog runners are professionals who will take your dog running, usually between 1 and 10 miles for a set fee, usually not more than 2 dogs at a time. In some jurisdictions dog walking businesses must be licensed and have animal first-aid-trained employees.

Claxton also wrote and illustrated many humorous commentaries on contemporary life.Life.Little is known of Claxton\'s life; even her birth and death dates are uncertain. Her father, painter Marshall Claxton, trained his daughters, Florence and Adelaide, in his craft; Florence travelled with her father to Australia, India, and Egypt in the years from 1850 to 1857, while he searched for employment. In the later 1850s both sisters found work in the production of engravings for the popular press. In 1860, Florence illustrated Married Off: A Satirical Poem, by H. B.In 1858 Florence exhibited her painting Scenes from the Life of a Female Artist in the second annual show of the Society of Women Artists. In the following year, 1859, she signed a petition advocating the admission of women to the Royal Academy Schools, and exhibited her Scenes of Life of an Old Maid in the Society of Women Artists show.The Choice of Paris.Claxton\'s best-known work is The Choice of Paris: An Idyll (c. 1860), a satire on, and parody of, the works of the Pre-Raphaelite artists of the previous years. The painting is patterned after William Holman Hunt\'s A Converted British Family sheltering a Christian Missionary from the persecution of the Druids, and combines caricatures of many of the main figures of the movement, including John Ruskin and Sir John Everett Millais, with figures of popular culture like P. T. Barnum, and allusions to the great artists of the past. It depicts Millais in the role of Paris, offering the golden apple to a scrawny-looking medieval woman, ignoring a Raphael madonna (copied from The Marriage of the Virgin) and a modern woman in crinolines. The painting also includes parodies of other Pre-Raphaelite works, including Millais\' Sir Isumbras at the Ford, Spring: Apple Blossoms and The Vale of Rest. It also caricatures Calderon\'s Broken Vows and Windus\'s Burd Helen. The picture was reproduced as a full-page engraving by the Illustrated London News.Other works.Other examples of Claxton\'s works were also reproduced in newspapers of the day. In Utopian Christmas, reproduced in the Illustrated London News of 24 December 1859, the poor - barefooted and raggedly-dressed - are shown feasting at a lavish banquet and being served and entertained by the rich - depicted as generals, nobles, and finely-dressed ladies.Other works by Claxton include Women\'s Work: A Medley (1861) and Scenes from the Life of a Governess (1863). Women\'s Work may have been a feminist riposte to Ford Madox Brown\'s painting Work, which focused on men\'s labors but neglected women.Florence Claxton married a Mr. Farrington, of Romsey, in 1868, but continued to work and exhibit at least sporadically afterward.Claxton also wrote humorous skits on feminism and women\'s rights, most notably in The Adventures of a Woman in Search of her Rights, a story in cartoon form. In the book, a young woman falls in love with a dashing youth, but her parents do not approve and her lover leaves. She decides to pursue her rights. She loses her looks through the study of John Stuart Mill and; now made ugly, she pursues various careers, becoming a lawyer, a politician and a doctor, but eventually fails in all of her pursuits.

Six actors depict different facets of Dylan\'s public personas: Christian Bale, Cate Blanchett, Marcus Carl Franklin, Richard Gere, Heath Ledger, and Ben Whishaw. A caption at the start of the film declares it to be inspired by the music and the many lives of Bob Dylan; this is the only mention of Dylan in the film apart from song credits, and his only appearance in it is concert footage from 1966 shown during the film\'s final moments.The film tells its story using non-traditional narrative techniques, intercutting the storylines of seven different Dylan-inspired characters. The title of the film is taken from the 1967 Dylan Basement Tape recording of I\'m Not There, a song that had not been officially released until it appeared on the film\'s soundtrack album. The film received a generally favorable response, and appeared on several top ten films lists for 2007, topping the lists for The Village Voice, Entertainment Weekly, Salon and The Boston Globe. Particular praise went to Cate Blanchett for her performance, culminating in a Volpi Cup for Best Actress from the Venice Film Festival, the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, along with an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress nomination. This was Heath Ledger\'s final film to be released during his lifetime.Plot.I\'m Not There uses a nonlinear narrative, shifting between six characters in separate storylines inspired by the music and many lives of Bob Dylan. Each character represents a different facet of Dylan\'s public persona: poet (Arthur Rimbaud), prophet (Jack Rollins/Father John), outlaw (Billy McCarty), fake (Woody Guthrie), rock and roll martyr (Jude Quinn), and star of electricity (Robbie Clark).Arthur Rimbaud.19 year-old Arthur Rimbaud is questioned by interrogators. His cryptic responses are interspersed throughout the film, including remarks on fatalism, the nature of poets, seven simple rules for life in hiding, and chaos.Woody Guthrie.In 1959, an 11 year-old African American boy calling himself Woody Guthrie is freighthopping through the Midwestern United States. Carrying a guitar in a case bearing the slogan this machine kills fascists, he plays blues music and sings about outdated topics such as trade unionism. One African American woman advises him to sing about the issues of his own time instead. Woody is attacked by hobos and nearly drowns, but is rescued by a white couple who take him in. They are impressed with his musical talents, but Woody runs off when they receive a telephone call from a juvenile corrections center in Minnesota telling them he is an escaped fugitive. Upon learning that the real Woody Guthrie is deathly ill, Woody travels to New Jersey to visit Guthrie in the hospital.Jack Rollins/Father John.The career of folk musician Jack Rollins is framed as a documentary film, told by interviewees including folk singer Alice Fabian. Jack becomes a star of the Greenwich Village folk scene in the early 1960s, praised by fans for his protest songs. He signs to Columbia Records, but in 1963, just as the Vietnam War is escalating, he stops singing protest songs and turns away from folk music, believing that neither effects real social or political change. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Jack gets drunk at a ceremony where he is receiving an award from a civil rights organization. Remarking in his acceptance speech that he saw something of himself in Kennedy\'s assassin Lee Harvey Oswald, he is booed and derided by the audience. He goes into hiding, and in 1974 enters a bible study course in Stockton, California and emerges a born again Christian, denouncing his past and becoming an ordained minister performing gospel music under the name Father John.Robbie Clark.Robbie Clark is a 22 year-old actor who plays Jack Rollins in the 1965 biographical film Grain of Sand. During filming in Greenwich Village in January 1964, he falls in love with French artist Claire, and they soon marry. Grain of Sand is a hit and Jack becomes a star, but their relationship is strained and Claire observes Robbie flirting with other women. She is particularly offended when, during an argument in 1968 over whether the evils of the world can be changed, he opines that women can never be poets. Eventually Robbie moves out of their house, then goes to London for four months to film a thriller and has an affair with his female co-star. Richard Nixon\'s January 1973 announcement of the Paris Peace Accords inspires Claire to ask for a divorce. She gains custody of their two daughters, but allows Robbie to take them on a boating trip.Jude Quinn.Jude Quinn is a popular former folk singer whose performance with a full band and electric guitars at a New England jazz and folk festival outrages his fans, who accuse him of selling out. Travelling to London, Jude is asked by journalist Keenan Jones if he still cares about people, or thinks folk music has failed to achieve its goals of sociopolitical change. Jude is attacked by a hotel employee, hangs out with The Beatles, encounters his former lover Coco Rivington, and meets poet Allen Ginsberg, who suggests that Jude sold out to God. Interviewing Jude, Keenan notes that Jude\'s songs are being used as recruitment tools by the Black Panther Party and opines that Jude refuses to feel deeply about anything while simultaneously being very self-conscious; Jude is offended and walks out of the interview. At a concert performing Ballad of a Thin Man, Jude is booed and called a Judas by the audience. Keenan reveals on television that, despite his claims of a rough-and-tumble vagabond past, Jude is actually Aaron Jacob Edelstein, the suburban, middle-class, educated son of a Brookline, Massachusetts department store owner. Faced with a long string of upcoming European tour dates, Jude spirals into drug use and is killed in a motorcycle accident.Billy McCarty.Outlaw Billy McCarty, believed to have been killed by Pat Garrett, lives in hiding in rural Riddle, Missouri. Learning that Commissioner Garrett plans to demolish the town to build a highway, which has caused several townspeople to commit suicide, Billy confronts Garrett. Garrett recognizes Billy as the outlaw Billy the Kid and has him thrown in jail. He is broken out by his friend Homer and hops into a boxcar on a passing train, where he finds Woody\'s guitar. As he rides away, he remarks on the nature of freedom and identity.The film concludes with footage of Dylan playing a harmonica solo during a live performance.Main cast.These six characters represent different aspects of Dylan\'s life and music.Development.Dylan gave Haynes permission to proceed with his project. Haynes developed his screenplay with writer Oren Moverman. In the course of writing, Haynes has acknowledged that he became uncertain whether he could successfully carry off a film which deliberately confused biography with fantasy in such an extreme way. According to the account of the film that Robert Sullivan published in the New York Times: Haynes called Jeff Rosen, Dylans right hand, who was watching the deal-making but staying out of the scriptwriting. Rosen, he said, told him not to worry, that it was just his own crazy version of what Dylan is.A further Dylan-based character named Charlie, based on Charlie Chaplin, was dropped before filming began. Haynes described him as a little tramp, coming to Greenwich Village and performing feats of magic and being an arbiter of peace between the beats and the folkies.Filming.Principal photography took place in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Music festival scenes were filmed in Chambly, Quebec in the summer of 2006.Music.The film features numerous songs by Dylan, performed by Dylan and also recordings by other artists. The songs feature as both foregroundperformed by artists on camera (e.g. Goin\' to Acapulco, Pressing On)and background accompaniment to the action. A notable non-Dylan song in the movie is (I\'m Not Your) Steppin\' Stone by The Monkees, which plays in the background of a party scene set in London.Release.I\'m Not There premiered at the 34th Telluride Film Festival in August 2007. It played the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2007. The film opened in limited release in the United States in November 2007.Home media.I\'m Not There was released on DVD as a 2-disc special edition on May 6, 2008. The DVD special features include audio commentary from Haynes, deleted scenes, featurettes, a music video, audition tapes for certain cast members, trailers, and a Bob Dylan filmography and discography.Critical response.I\'m Not There received generally positive reviews from critics. On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 76% approval rating based on 157 reviews, with an average rating of 7 out 10. The site\'s critical consensus states: I\'m Not Theres unique editing, visuals, and multiple talented actors portraying Bob Dylan make for a deliciously unconventional experience. Each segment brings a new and fresh take on Dylan\'s life. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 35 reviews.Writing in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Anthony DeCurtis said that casting six different actors, including a woman and an African-American child, to play Dylan was a preposterous idea, the sort of self-consciously \'audacious\'or reassuringly multi-cultigambit that, for instance, doomed the Broadway musical based on the life and music of John Lennon. Yet in I\'m Not There, the strategy works brilliantly. He especially praised Blanchett: Several critics praised Blanchett\'s performance as the mid-60s Dylan. Newsweek magazine described Blanchett as so convincing and intense that you shrink back in your seat when she fixes you with her gaze. The Charlotte Observer called Blanchett miraculously close to the 1966 Dylan.Todd McCarthy of Variety, concluded that the film was well-made, but was ultimately a speciality event for Dylan fans, with little mainstream appeal. He wrote: Dylan freaks and scholars will have the most fun with I\'m Not There, and there will inevitably be innumerable dissertations on the ways Haynes has both reflected and distorted reality, mined and manipulated the biographical record and otherwise had a field day with the essentials, as well as the esoterica, of Dylan\'s life. All of this will serve to inflate the film\'s significance by ignoring its lack of more general accessibility. In the end, it\'s a specialists\' event. For Roger Ebert, the film was enjoyable cinematically, yet never sought to resolve the enigmas of Dylan\'s life and work: Coming away from I\'m Not There, we have, first of all, heard some great music...We\'ve seen six gifted actors challenged by playing facets of a complete man. We\'ve seen a daring attempt at biography as collage. We\'ve remained baffled by the Richard Gere cowboy sequence, which doesn\'t seem to know its purpose. And we have been left not one step closer to comprehending Bob Dylan, which is as it should be.Dylan\'s response.In September 2012, Dylan commented on I\'m Not There in an interview published in Rolling Stone. When journalist Mikal Gilmore asked Dylan whether he liked the film, he responded: Yeah, I thought it was all right. Do you think that the director was worried that people would understand it or not? I don\'t think he cared one bit. I just think he wanted to make a good movie. I thought it looked good, and those actors were incredible.Top ten lists.The film appeared on several critics\' lists of the top ten films of 2007.'),(34773429,'Doi_Khun_Tan_National_Park','Doi Khun Tan National Park.Doi Khun Tan National Park () straddles the mountainous area of the Khun Tan Range in Lamphun and Lampang Provinces, northern Thailand.Established in 1975 as Thailand\'s tenth national park, it is an IUCN Category V protected area measuring.

Ad hoc is Latin and means for this (i.e., for this purpose).Each device in a MANET is free to move independently in any direction, and will therefore change its links to other devices frequently. Each must forward traffic unrelated to its own use, and therefore be a router. The primary challenge in building a MANET is equipping each device to continuously maintain the information required to properly route traffic. Such networks may operate by themselves or may be connected to the larger Internet. They may contain one or multiple and different transceivers between nodes. This results in a highly dynamic, autonomous topology.MANETs are a kind of Wireless ad hoc network that usually has a routable networking environment on top of a Link Layer ad hoc network. MANETs consist of a peer-to-peer, self-forming, self-healing network. MANETs circa 2000-2015 typically communicate at radio frequencies (30MHz - 5GHz)The growth of laptops and Wi-Fi wireless networking have made MANETs a popular research topic since the mid-1990s. Many academic papers evaluate protocols and their abilities, assuming varying degrees of mobility within a bounded space, usually with all nodes within a few hops of each other. Different protocols are then evaluated based on measures such as the packet drop rate, the overhead introduced by the routing protocol, end-to-end packet delays, network throughput, ability to scale, etc.Simulations.There are several ways to study MANETs. One solution is the use of simulation tools like OPNET, NetSim and NS2.Data monitoring and mining.MANETS can be used for facilitating the collection of sensor data for data mining for a variety of applications such as air pollution monitoring and different types of architectures can be used for such applications. It should be noted that a key characteristic of such applications is that nearby sensor nodes monitoring an environmental feature typically register similar values. This kind of data redundancy due to the spatial correlation between sensor observations inspires the techniques for in-network data aggregation and mining. By measuring the spatial correlation between data sampled by different sensors, a wide class of specialized algorithms can be developed to develop more efficient spatial data mining algorithms as well as more efficient routing strategies. Also, researchers have developed performance models for MANET by applying queueing theory.'),(9193919,'John_Morison_(pastor)','John Morison (pastor).Rev. Dr John Morison (17911859) - occasionally spelt Morrison - was a longstanding editor of the Evangelical Magazine & Missionary Chronicle, author of theological and biographical subjects, and a Congregational pastor at Trevor Chapel, Knightsbridge, London. He was known for his bold and fervid utterances on the platform, his enthusiastic advocacy of the work of the London Missionary Society, and support for the abolition of slavery in the USA.Abolition and evangelical work.A native of Scotland, John Morison became one of the principal representatives of Congregationalism in London, during the mid-nineteenth century and a committee member of the London Missionary Society.He was ordained 17 February 1815, and became pastor of a congregation at Union Chapel, Sloane Street, Chelsea. In 1816 a larger place of worship was provided for him in the same parish. At the close of that year Trevor Chapel was opened, where he continued to labour for more than forty years. From about 1827 till 1857 he was editor of the \'Evangelical Magazine.\'Along with fellow LMS committee member, Thomas Raffles of Liverpool, and his friend the Alexander Fletcher of Finsbury Chapel, he was honoured to be one of the three people to whom the escaped slave Moses Roper brought a letter of introduction on his arrival in Britain, seeking assistance and patronage to pursue his object of promoting the cause of emancipation and abolition. To Morison, Moses Roper gave the task of revising the manuscript of his autobiography, A Narrative of the Adventures and Escapes of Moses Roper, but though illness he was compelled to pass this task, and preparation of the preface, to the Rev. Dr T. Price.Trevor Chapel.Dr Morrison\'s chapel, Trevor Chapel, was situated at Trevor Square (formerly Arthur Street), Knightsbridge, Kensington, and was demolished in the 1950s after being taken over for use by Harrods department store.In his early pastorate he had worked as minister at Union Chapel, Sloane Street. However, he resigned and was followed by some of his Independent congregation, who met in Smith & Babers floorcloth factory during 1816, until they could complete the building of their own Independent chapel at corner of Arthur Street and Lancelot Place. This opened in December 1816, largely paid for by a member of his congregation, John Souter, who bought a lease for the site of chapel, and several houses, in Trevor Square. Dr Morrison\'s Chapel was later enlarged, during the 1830s, and was completed with schoolrooms by the end of the decade. Shortly after his death a gallery was added in the 1860s, to the Congregational Chapel. He was succeeded at the chapel by his co-pastor, who also succeeded him as Editor of the Evangelical Magazine and Missionary Chronicle.Death and memorial.He died in London on 13 June 1859.Dr Morison is buried at the Congregationalists\'s non-denominational Victorian garden cemetery, Abney Park Cemetery, Stoke Newington, London, by a pedimented pedestal memorial of white marble.Family.He married in 1815 Elizabeth, second daughter of James Murray of Banff, and had several children.'),(46997952,'Holly_Grove_Historic_District','Holly Grove Historic District.The Holly Grove Historic District encompasses the historic central business district of Holly Grove, Arkansas.

The genus was first identified by pioneering bulb enthusiast William Herbert in 1824. The species are native to the Americas, from (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Mexico, Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay), but several species are naturalized in other parts of the world West Indies, India, South Africa, Mauritius, Colombia, Easter Island, and the southeastern United States.Description.Along with Zephyranthes and Cooperia, Habranthus is one of several related genera commonly known as rain lilies. All three have starry, funnel-shaped flowers and are native to tropical and semi-tropical regions of the Americas. Flowers are either solitary or in umbels of up to 4 flowers, and typically appear in late spring through to autumn in response to rain. Individual bulbs are often capable of blooming more than once per year.Habranthus is distinct from Zephyranthes in holding its flowers at an angle rather than upright and in having unequal stamens. It also has less symmetrical flowers.Taxonomy.At one stage, Habranthus was considered a subgenus of the closely related Hippeastrum.Cultivation.In the United States, Habranthus, like other rain lilies, is regarded as an heirloom plant, although it is not widely used in mainstream landscapes, perhaps because its bloom time, dependent on rain, is erratic. Nevertheless, the bulbs are rugged and easy to grow in USDA Hardiness Zones 8-10 and are recognized among bulb specialists as possessing distinct landscape value in appropriate areas of the world. In colder regions they may be grown in sheltered sites, or in pots kept frost-free in winter.The most commonly grown species are the pink-flowered H. robustus and the yellow-flowered H. tubispathus.List of species.The list of species accepted by the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families is shown below.'),(24865220,'Stelly_Plan','Stelly Plan.The Stelly Plan is a since repealed 2002 tax measure in the U.S. state of Louisiana designed to shift certain state sales taxes on food for home consumption and utilities to increases in state income taxes. Narrowly approved by voters, the proposal soon ran into criticism as middle-class taxpayers complained of paying much more in state income taxes than the amount of reduced sales taxes. The plan is named for former State Representative Victor T. Vic Stelly, a Lake Charles Republican, who served in the House from 1988-2004. Removal of the Stelly income tax tables began in calendar year 2009.In the November 5, 2002, general election, Louisiana voters approved the Stelly Plan, listed on the ballot as Act 88-2002, actually a constitutional amendment. The tabulation was 534,989 (51 percent) to 506,938 (49 percent).Details of Stelly Plan.Under the Stelly Plan, the state sales tax on food for home consumption and the sales tax on natural gas, electricity, and water for residential use was lowered on January 1, 2003, from 3.9 cents to 2 cents per dollar. Taxes on those items were then eliminated on July 1, 2003. To replace revenue lost through Stelly, individual income tax brackets were adjusted upward. Because individual tax returns for taxable year 2003 were not filed until after January 1, 2004, the withholding tax tables were revised, and the new rates went into effect on January 1, 2003.Stelly did not affect local sales taxes on food. Only food requiring preparation at home was covered by the reduction in state sales tax. Single-use portions or restaurant meals were not affected by the Stelly Plan. Prescription drugs were already exempt from sales taxes, but Stelly placed that exemption in the state Constitution. Louisiana does not exempt over-the-counter drugs from sales tax, but such items are exempt in neighboring Texas. Stelly also allowed the tax owed by the individual to be distributed over the year 2003. The increase in taxpayer withholding was to have been the same as the savings realized from the elimination of sales taxes under the Stelly Plan. Taxpayers making approximately $80,000 annually saw increases in total state taxes.Repeal.After years of criticism from those who faced higher taxes as a result of the Stelly Plan, the Louisiana State Legislature in 2008 repealed Stelly. The highest income brackets were returned to the level they were prior to 2003. The tax reduction began in 2009, but the state revenue department did not alter the withholding on individual income tax tables until July 1 of that year. Hence individuals did not receive more disposable income in their paychecks until after July 1 unless they had individually requested that their employers adjust their tax schedules prior to July. The repeal of Stelly could cost the state treasury some $358 million in taxes for the 2009-2010 fiscal year and somewhat less for each year thereafter.Stelly defenders.The Lafayette Daily Advertiser in Lafayette, which supported the Stelly Plan, described the measure as a sensible fiscal measure... developed essentially to make income taxes, instead of sales taxes, the primary funding mechanism for government.The Public Affairs Research Council, a business think-tank, said that the loss of income tax revenues would make Louisiana more reliant on less stable petroleum and natural gas revenues and creates the potential for a resumption of the boom-and-bust cycle.Part of it is human nature: People benefit a little bit every day from the sales taxes eliminated in 2002 by passage of the Stelly Plan. But everybody notices when they write a larger check for state income tax. Lawmakers are responding to aggrieved, mostly affluent constituents who pay big income tax bills.This is a commonly cited problem with the sales tax: even the low-income folks who are hit hardest by it often don\'t notice, because they pay a nickel here and a nickel there rather than one big lump sum. If people don\'t notice the sales tax when they pay it, it\'s easy to understand that they wouldn\'t notice when (as a result of the Stelly sales tax cuts) they\'re not longer paying it.... Stelly critics.Governor Bobby Jindal at first opposed the repeal as too costly to declining state coffers but then championed it as public reaction against the measure accelerated.Jeffrey D. Sadow, a professor of political science at Louisiana State University in Shreveport and active conservative blogger, in 2005 described the Stelly Plan, accordingly: In essence... just another link in the long history of Louisiana tax policy that favors redistribution and discourages economic development. It\'s that kind of thinking that has gotten us into an economic mess... Several lawmakers have also opposed the Stelly Plan\'s removal of certain state income tax deductions. Former legislators Pete Schneider of Slidell, James David Cain of Beauregarde Parish, and Peppi Bruneau of New Orleans attempted unsuccessfully to restore deductions removed for charitable contributions and home mortgage interest.'),(18760137,'List_of_dams_and_reservoirs_in_Alaska','List of dams and reservoirs in Alaska.Alaska has about 67 named artificial reservoirs, approximately 167 named dams,and about 3,197 officially named natural lakes, out of over 3,000,000 unnamed natural lakes.For named natural lakes, please see: List of lakes of Alaska.The following is an incomplete list of named artificial reservoirs and named dams in the US state of Alaska.'),(8502851,'2006_Kolkata_leather_factory_fire','2006 Kolkata leather factory fire.The 2006 Kolkata leather factory fire was a deadly industrial fire that occurred in West Bengal, India, on 22 November 2006. The fire broke out in a leather bag factory located in the Tannix International, Topsia, in the South 24 Parganas district in Greater Kolkata area, and generated a wave of criticism of the poor safety standards in place among the country\'s sweatshops.The industrial fire claimed the lives of at least ten people, who were unable to escape because the doors were locked shut illegally. Authorities, in response to local residents\' angry criticism, admitted that the emergency response to the accident was substandard. Two separate investigations were launched. One inquiry focused on the fire itself, while the other sought to ascertain criminal responsibility for the disaster as well as the operation of the illegal factory. The results of both are either pending or have yet to be released to the general public.Background.Investigators confirmed that the site of the fire had been used as an illegal factory to manufacture leather bags. The factory was located on the third floor of a four-story building, which also featured residential units. Investigators determined that the first and second floors of the structure housed additional illegal factories. The factory destroyed in the fire was found to be owned and operated by Tenex Exports, and all of the people who were killed or injured in the fire slept in the factory at night, a situation that is not considered unusual in India. There was had just one emergency exit, and 40 workers were housed in the structure at the time of the fire, and the owner had locked the factory at night to prevent workers from running away with leather goods. The building was located in the Tannix International, Topsia, in the South 24 Parganas district of Greater Kolkata region.Event and emergency response.The fire broke out in the factory at around 2:30 IST, as workers slept. Once they became aware of the blaze, the employees found they were unable to break through the factory\'s locked doors. Five fire tenders were sent to the scene, but by the time they arrived, local residents had broken down two locked gates and already rescued the surviving workers. These impromptu Rescue efforts were delayed however, when an individual carrying keys to open the door nervously dropped them while attempting to open the gate. At least 10 people were dead by the time rescuers reached the factory\'s interior, with a further eighteen injured. The survivors, many suffering from burns over 70 percent of their bodies, were taken to the National Medical College and Hospital, where victims had to be left on the floor due to a shortage of beds. The hospital did not have a burns unit, and the only treatments available at the hospital were ointments and saline drips. The patients were eventually moved to other hospitals. Local MLA Javed Khan later said that the death toll is actually at least twelve, but there has been no official confirmation of this. The Rapid Action Force was also deployed to maintain calm.Criticisms of the emergency response.People living in the vicinity of the illegal factory said that the number of deaths might have been reduced had the fire service responded promptly. They claimed that the fire brigade failed to send personnel or equipment to the scene until more than an hour after the brigade first received word of the fire. Residents also claimed that it was only after the police arrived and requested fire service backup that any help was sent. In addition, some on the scene reported an inadequate number of ambulances. The city\'s mayor admitted to this lapse the following morning. Local people also complained that the victims should never have been taken to the Calcutta National Medical College, but that they should have been transported directly to hospitals with burns units.Accident investigation.An investigation has been launched to determine the cause of the fire as well as the reason the building had been locked from the outside. To this end, the building was inspected by the KMC, and was subsequently scheduled to be demolished on Thursday, November 23. However, the structure is standing. Although no actual cause of the fire has been established, it has been noted that large quantities of inflammable materials, such as adhesives, were stored inside the building. It was also revealed that the factory experienced a similar fire two years previously, but on that occasion there were no fatalities.Criminal investigation.A separate criminal investigation focused on the illegal factory itself. Almost all factories and homes in the area were illegal and unauthorised, and do not follow building codes and sanctions. Mayor Bikash Ranjan Bhattacharya said action would be taken against the owners of the factory and house, and Superintendent of Police of South 24 Parganas S. N. Gupta said that the owners of the building would be arrested. Investigation has shown that the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) issued notices to the building on three separate occasions, in 1988, 1989, and 1992, yet took no further action. It has been shown, however, that the KMC also approved trade licences for two businesses to operate from the building. The owner of the building, Khurshid Alam, has had a police complaint filed against him by the fire department for illegal construction charges. Mohammed Sagir Ahmed and Mohammed Asif, the owners of Tenex Exports, also face related charges. Both investigations are ongoing.Aftermath.The day after this tragedy, workers in the unorganized leather industry of Topsia area held protest rallies demanding compensation for the relatives of the deceased workers, better working conditions and a probe into the fire mishap. The mayor of Kolkata convened an all-party meeting to discuss the incident and also promised to initiate a drive demolish illegal constructions in the area. The labour inspectors inspected the building and declared the factory as illegal. Even though the building was declared illegal and unsafe, a month later, the police raided the house and found that another leather factory was operating behind closed doors in the ground floor of the building. The civic officials issued a notice to stop any work in the building. Though local residents alleged that clandestine work started in the building with the help of local MLA, Javen Khan, Khan himself blamed it rather on the police.In 2008, two more fire mishaps occurred in the leather industries in the area, one in the month of March and the other in June: a total of nine people got injured in these two incidents. Even though fire safety licenses and insurances for the workers of the leather factories were made mandatory after the fire incident of 2006, none of the authoritiesthe municipal corporation, the services department of the state government, and the policeensured that these were actually followed by the factories. The local residents claimed that the owner of the factory that was impacted in the fire incident of 2006, now operates from another address of the same area. According to fire brigade officials, the Topsia area along with nearby Tiljala and Tangra forms the most fire-prone area of the city, and that around three to four fires break out every week, though they do not get reported in the media as there is no loss of life.'),(16583123,'Albert_Brunies','Albert Brunies.Albert Abbie Brunies (January 19, 1900 - October 2, 1978) was an American jazz cornetist.Brunies came from a famous New Orleans musical family, which counted among its members George Brunies and Merritt Brunies.

After Ned Spoon split in the early \'70s, he and his brother, Willie, formed Highway, an acoustic hippy duo. With the arrival of the 1980s, the brothers formed the short-lived new wave/synthpop band Minor Detail. It became the first Irish band to secure a recording contract with an American label, but released only one album. Their album was produced by Bill Whelan (of Riverdance fame).Discovering the Corrs.In 1991, Hughes started a band called Hughes Version, featuring Jim Corr on keyboards. Hughes was also working as musical coordinator for the movie The Commitments. Jim Corr simultaneously decided to audition with his three sisters, unbeknownst to Hughes at the time. Commitments casting director Ros Hubbard who had heard them perform, convinced Hughes to become the band\'s manager despite his total lack of prior experience. Hughes remains The Corrs\' manager to this day.Wild Ocean.Hughes put his own music aside when taking over the Corrs but in 1999 went back into the studio to write and record new material. The result was Wild Ocean, released in 2004 by 14th Floor Records/Warner Records. The album\'s name was supposedly suggested by Andrea Corr.Wild Ocean also features the musical talent of The Corrs, The Chieftains, and newcomer Tara Blaise who co-wrote and is a featured vocalist on several tracks.

As well as running the first racially integrated night club in the United States, Josephson also intended the club to defy the pretensions of the rich; he chose the name to mock Clare Boothe Luce and what she referred to as caf society, the habitus of more upscale nightclubs, and that wry satirical note was carried through in murals. Josephson not only trademarked the name, which had not been trademarked by the gossip columnist for the New York Journal American M, who wrote as the first Cholly Knickerbocker, but advertised the club as The Wrong Place for the Right People. Josephson opened a second branch on 58th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenue, in 1940. After that, the original club was known as Caf Society Downtown and the new club - designed for a different audience - as Caf Society Uptown.The club also prided itself on treating black and white customers equally, unlike many venues, such as the Cotton Club, that featured black performers but barred black customers except for prominent blacks in the entertainment industry. The club featured many of the greatest black musicians of the day, from a wide range of backgrounds, often presented with a strongly political bent. Lena Horne was persuaded to stop singing When it\'s Sleepy Time Down South, Pearl Bailey was fired for being too much of an Uncle Tom, and Carol Channing was fired for an impersonation of Ethel Waters. Billie Holiday first sang Strange Fruit there; at Josephson\'s insistence, she closed her set with this song, leaving the stage without taking any encores, so that the audience would be left to think about the meaning of the song.Relying on the keen musical judgment of John Hammond, the club\'s unofficial music director, Josephson helped launch the careers of Ruth Brown, Lena Horne, dancer Pearl Primus, Hazel Scott, Big Joe Turner, and Sarah Vaughan, and [popularized gospel groups such as the Dixie Hummingbirds and the Golden Gate Quartet among white audiences. Many of these acts had first been presented at Hammond\'s Carnegie Hall concerts, From Spirituals to Swing, in 1938 and 1939.As part of the challenge to integrate America\'s segregated society, Josephson\'s club was the scene of numerous political events and fundraisers, often for left-wing causes, both during and after World War II. In 1947, Josephson\'s brother Leon Josephson was subpoenaed by the House Committee on Un-American Activities, which led to hostile comments from columnists Westbrook Pegler and Walter Winchell.

He played an important role in the development of Flemish art in the first half of the 17th century through his innovations in genre painting and introduction of new subject matter.Life.Francken was born in Antwerp where he trained with his father Frans Francken the Elder. He may also have trained with his uncle Hieronymus Francken I in Paris, together with his brother Hieronymus Francken II. He became a master in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1605 and was deacon of the Guild in 1616.Francken was a very successful artist and operated a large workshop which made many copies of his original compositions.His pupils included Daniel Hagens (1616/17), the Monogrammist N.F., his brother Hieronymus II and his son Frans III.General.Frans Francken the Younger was a versatile artist who practised in many genres and introduced new subjects into Flemish art. Many of his works are small historical, allegorical and biblical cabinet paintings with the focus on figures. He also invented or popularized several new themes that became popular in Flemish painting, such as genre scenes populated by monkeys (also referred to as singeries) and Kunstkammer or gallery paintings displaying a wealth of natural and artistic treasures against a neutral wall. Frans Francken the Younger introduced many other unusual themes that later became popular, such as the \'Triumphal Procession of Amphitrite\' and \'Croesus and Solon\'. Francken also made a series of paintings depicting witches and witchcraft, including portrayals of witches\' sabbats.Frans Francken the Younger signed his works with \'de jonge Frans Francken\' (\'the young Frans Francken\') before the death of his father in 1616. From the late 1620s he used the signature \'de oude Fr. Francken\' (\'the old Fr. Francken\').His paintings are held by most major museums in Europe.Allegorical paintings.A large portion of the output of Frans Francken the Younger consisted of allegorical paintings. An example is the Allegory on the Abdication of Emperor Charles V in Brussels (Rijksmuseum). The composition is an allegorical representation of the abdication of Emperor Charles V in Brussels. Charles V who is dividing his empire after a life of continuous warfare and ill health is seated on his thrown flanked by his successors Ferdinand I and Philip II. In front of Philip the personifications of the territories of the Empire with their banners are kneeling down. In the foreground the personifications of the continents America, Africa, Europe and Asia are offering gifts. On the left Neptune is riding his seahorse-drawn triumphal chariot, accompanied by mermen, mermaids and tritons. On the chariot are visible a globe and the two columns with a banderole inscribed with Plus Ultra.Another allegorical painting is the composition Mankind\'s Eternal Dilemma: The Choice Between Virtue and Vice (on loan to the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. It is believed to have been painted at the occasion of a wedding and mixes mythological and Christian symbolism. It represents the eternal choice of mankind between virtue and vice and depicts the three regions of heaven, earth and hell.Singeries.Frans Francken contributed to the development of the genre of the \'monkey scene\', also called \'singerie\' (a word, which in French means a \'comical grimace, behaviour or trick\'). Comical scenes with monkeys appearing in human attire and a human environment are a pictorial genre that was initiated in Flemish painting in the 16th century and was subsequently further developed in the 17th century. The Flemish engraver Pieter van der Borcht introduced the singerie as an independent theme around 1575 in a series of prints, which are strongly embedded in the artistic tradition of Pieter Bruegel the Elder. These prints were widely disseminated and the theme was then picked up by other Flemish artists. The first one to do so was Frans Francken the Younger who played an important role in the development of the genre. Other Antwerp artists subsequently contributing to the genre were Jan Brueghel the Elder and the Younger, Sebastiaen Vrancx and Jan van Kessel the Elder. David Teniers the Younger became the principal practitioner of the genre and developed it further with his younger brother Abraham Teniers. Later in the 17th century Nicolaes van Verendael started to paint these monkey scenes as well.Gallery paintings.Frans Francken the Younger and Jan Brueghel the Elder were the first artists to create paintings of art and curiosity collections in the 1620s. Gallery paintings depict large rooms in which many paintings and other precious items are displayed in elegant surroundings. The earliest works in this genre depicted art objects together with other items such as scientific instruments or peculiar natural specimens. Some gallery paintings include portraits of the owners or collectors of the art objects or artists at work. The paintings are heavy with symbolism and allegory and are a reflection of the intellectual preoccupations of the age, including the cultivation of personal virtue and the importance of connoisseurship. The genre became immediately quite popular and was followed by other artists such as Jan Brueghel the Younger, Cornelis de Baellieur, Hans Jordaens, David Teniers the Younger, Gillis van Tilborch and Hieronymus Janssens.Collaborations.As Francken was particularly skilled in painting the human figure, he frequently collaborated with other artists, such as the landscape artists Tobias Verhaecht, Abraham Govaerts and Joos de Momper, the architectural painters Pieter Neeffs the Elder, Pieter Neeffs the Younger, Hendrik van Steenwijk I, Paul Vredeman de Vries and Bartholomeus van Bassen and flower painters such as Jan Brueghel the Elder and Andries Daniels.Garland paintings.Francken often collaborated with Andries Daniels and Jan Brueghel the Elder and Younger in the production of garland paintings. Garland paintings are a special type of still life developed in Antwerp by artists such as Jan Brueghel the Elder, Hendrick van Balen, Andries Daniels, Peter Paul Rubens and Daniel Seghers. They typically show a flower garland around a devotional image or portrait. This genre was inspired by the cult of veneration and devotion to Mary prevalent at the Habsburg court (then the rulers over the Southern Netherlands) and in Antwerp generally.Garland paintings were usually collaborations between a still life and a figure painter. Together with Andries Daniels, Frans Francken further developed the genre of garland paintings, creating many special forms, among them garlands around medallions with the decades of the rosary.Religious works.Later in his life Francken also painted large altarpieces. Among his religiously themed works of particular note are the unusual and stylistically \'reactionary\' paintings of biblical scenes, which are framed on all sides by smaller scenes in grisaille. The grisaille frame echoes the Renaissance ecclesiastical portal. Each grisaille scene has its own naturalistic perspective and as a result the compositions provide an odd mixture of three-dimensional naturalism and archaic flatness. An example is the \' (Dayton Art Institute). Francken used this archaizing technique into the 1620s. This style was possibly invented in the 16th century by the Flemish painter Gillis Mostaert and some works of Mostaert in this style have been erroneously attributed to Frans Francken.'),(38861905,'Metal_Open_Air','Metal Open Air.Metal Open Air (also known simply as MOA) was an unsuccessful 2012 heavy metal festival. It took place between 2022 April, at the Parque Independncia, 25km southeast from downtown So Lus, Maranho, northeastern Brazil.

However, the promoters failed to obtain official permission to use the name, so they decided to switch it for Metal Open Air. From that moment on, several bands, including Shaman, Megadeth, Symphony X and Anthrax, started to confirm their performances, though a few have cancelled, including Shadowside, Krisiun, and Volbeat, mostly for logistical reasons.The headliners of the second day, the Rock and Roll All Stars, were a supergroup composed of Gene Simmons, Joe Elliott, Matt Sorum, Duff McKagan, Gilby Clarke, Glenn Hughes, Ed Roland, Sebastian Bach, Steve Stevens, Mike Inez, Billy Duffy and Charlie Sheen, who was to be the festival\'s master of ceremonies.The festival and the cancellations.Terra Prima\'s members didn\'t receive their air tickets to So Lus nor the confirmation of their accommodations in the city.Ricardo Confessori, drummer for Almah, publicly contested Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian for canceling the band\'s performance at the festival, accusing him of not giving a good excuse for the fans, to which Ian replied that the problem was the whole terrible organization. We never want to cancel but they made it impossible.In the end, a total of 30 of the 47 invited bands cancelled their performances due to the severe logistical, structural and financial problems regarding the festival. As for the fans, some had to camp inside stables, with almost no electricity, lack of places to buy food, beverage and hygiene products and only one public toilet.Aftermath.Soon after MOA was cancelled, both companies responsible for the festival (Negri Concerts and Lamparina Filmes e Produes) accused each other of breaking contractual rules.'),(40561130,'Qarah_Gonay-e_Olya','Qarah Gonay-e Olya.Qarah Gonay-e Olya (, also Romanized as Qarah Gonay-e Oly; also known as Qarah Gn-ye Oly) is a village in Charuymaq-e Sharqi Rural District, Shadian District, Charuymaq County, East Azerbaijan Province, Iran.

Riot Grrrl is a recent young feminist (sub)cultural movement that combines feminist consciousness and punk aesthetics, politics and style. It is often associated with third-wave feminism, which is sometimes seen as its starting point. It has also been described as a musical genre that came out of indie rock, with the punk scene serving as an inspiration for a musical movement in which women could express themselves in the same way men had been doing for the past several years.Riot grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, racism, patriarchy, and female empowerment. Bands associated with the movement include Bikini Kill, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Excuse 17, Huggy Bear, Cake Like, Skinned Teen, Emily\'s Sassy Lime, Sleater-Kinney, and also queercore groups like Team Dresch. In addition to a music scene and genre, riot grrrl is a subculture involving a DIY ethic, zines, art, political action, and activism. The Riot grrrl movement quickly spread well beyond its musical roots to create vibrant zine and World Wide Web-based movement, complete with local meetings and grassroots organizing to end ageism, homophobia, racism, sexism and, especially, physical and emotional violence against women and girls. Riot grrrls are known to hold meetings, start chapters, and support and organize women in music.History.During the summer of 1997, the riotgrrl convention happened in Boston. Bands from all over the country came to play for a mostly female, mostly white, mostly young audience.Origins.During the late 1970s and early and mid-1980s there were a number of female punk and rock musicians that later influenced the riot grrrl ethos. These included Siouxsie Sioux, Poly Styrene, The Slits, Au Pairs, The Raincoats, Patti Smith, Chrissie Hynde, The Runaways/Joan Jett, The B-52\'s, LiLiPUT, Lydia Lunch, Exene Cervenka, Kim Gordon, Ut, Neo Boys, Bush Tetras, Y Pants, ESG, Chalk Circle, Fifth Column, Frightwig, Scrawl, and Anti-Scrunti Faction. The 1980s also featured a number of female folk singers from New York whose lyrics were realistic and socio-political, but also personally intimate.During the mid-1980s in Vancouver the influential Mecca Normal fronted by poet Jean Smith formed, followed by Sugar Baby Doll in San Francisco whose members would all wind up in hardcore female bands. In 1987, the magazine Sassy premiered and dealt with tough subjects that conventional magazines aimed at teenage girls did not. An article Women, sex and rock and roll published by Puncture in 1989 became the first manifesto of the movement. In 1991, a radio program hosted by Lois Maffeo entitled Your Dream Girl aimed at angry young women debuted on Olympia, Washington radio station KAOS.During the early 1990s the Seattle/Olympia Washington area had a sophisticated do it yourself infrastructure. Young women involved in underground music scenes took advantage of this to articulate their feminist thoughts and desires through creating punk-rock fanzines and forming garage bands. The political model of collage-based, photocopied handbills and booklets was already used by the punk movement as a way to activate underground music, leftist politics and alternative (to mainstream) sub-cultures. There was a discomfort among many women in the punk movement who felt that they had no space for organizing, because of the misogyny in the punk culture. Many women found that while they identified with a larger, music-oriented subculture, they often had little to no voice in their local scenes. Women at the punk-rock shows saw themselves as girlfriends of the boys, so they took it upon themselves to represent their own interests by making their own fanzines, music and art.In 1991, young women coalesced in an unorganized collective response to several women\'s issues, such the Christian Coalition\'s Right to Life attack on legal abortion and the Senate Judiciary Hearings into Anita Hill\'s accusations of sexual harassment by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Young feminist voices were heard through multiple protests, actions, and events such as the formative opening night of the International Pop Underground Convention and later L7\'s Rock for Choice.Uses and meanings of the term riot grrrl developed slowly over time, but its etymological origins can be traced to the actual Mount Pleasant race riots in spring 1991. Bratmobile member Jen Smith (later of Rastro! and The Quails), used the phrase girl riot in a letter to Allison Wolfe describing the atmosphere among women in the city. Soon afterwards, Wolfe and Molly Neuman collaborated with Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail to create a new zine and called it Riot Grrrl, combining the riot with an oft-used phrase that first appeared in Vail\'s fanzine Jigsaw Revolution Grrrl Style Now. Riot grrrls took a growling double or triple r, placing it in the word girl, as a way to take back the derogatory use of the term.Although they\'re known for frequently denying exclusive credit for the movement, two bands in particular remain inextricably linked to its early formation.Bikini Kill.I feel completely left out of the realm of everything that is so important to me. And I know that this is partly because punk rock is for and by boys mostly and partly because punk rock of this generation is coming of age in a time of mindless career-goal bands.They started working together on another fanzine called Bikini Kill, which, after recruiting friends Kathi Wilcox and Billy Boredom Karren, would eventually become a band.Bratmobile.Allison Wolfe met Molly Neuman at the University of Oregon. Wolfe introduced Neuman to bands such as Beat Happening and The Melvins, Neuman introduced Wolfe to sociology classes and Public Enemy.They began working on zines called Girl Germs, and later riot grrrl with Tobi Vail, Kathleen Hanna and Jen Smith.It was a really hippie town, and we were getting really politicized, but also really into this DIY thing, so we kinda started creating. \'Let\'s make our own fanzine!\'Wolfe and Neuman started frequenting shows by bands like Fugazi and Nirvana. In 1990, Calvin Johnson called them up and asked them to play a show on Valentine\'s Day with Some Velvet Sidewalk and the newly formed Bikini Kill. They accepted it as a dare and played the show at Olympia\'s North Shore Surf club. Guitarist Erin Smith joined in March 1991.International Pop Underground Convention.As the corporate ogre expands its creeping influence on the minds of industrialized youth, the time has come for the International Rockers of the World to convene in celebration of our grand independence. Hangman hipsters, new mod rockers, sidestreet walkers, scooter-mounted dream girls, punks, teds, the instigators of the Love Rock Explosion, the editors of every angry grrrl zine, the plotters of youth rebellion in every form, the midwestern librarians and Scottish ski instructors who live by night, all are setting aside August 2025, 1991 as the time.An all-female bill on the first night, called Love Rock Revolution Girl Style Now! signalled a major step in the movement. The lineup featured Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy, Nikki McClure, Lois Maffeo, Jean Smith of Mecca Normal, 7 Year Bitch, and two side projects of Kathleen Hanna: the first was Suture with Sharon Cheslow of Chalk Circle (DC\'s first all-women punk band) and Dug E. Bird of Beefeater, the second was the Wondertwins with Tim Green of Nation of Ulysses. It was here that so many zinester people who\'d only known each other from networking, mail, or talking on the phone, finally met and were brought together by an entire night of music dedicated to, for, and by women.The convention featured other bands such as Unwound, L7, The Fastbacks, The Spinanes, Shadowy Men on a Shadowy Planet, Girl Trouble, The Pastels, Kicking Giant, Rose Melberg, Seaweed, Kreviss, I Scream Truck, Scrawl, Nation of Ulysses, Jad Fair, Thee Headcoats, and Steve Fisk, and spoken-word artist Juliana Luecking.Decline and later developments.By the mid-nineties, riot grrrl had severely splintered. Many within the movement felt that the mainstream media had completely misrepresented their message, and that the politically radical aspects of riot grrrl had been subverted by the likes of the Spice Girls and their girl power message, or co-opted by ostensibly women-centered bands (though sometimes with only one female performer per band) and festivals like Lilith Fair.Of the original riot grrrl bands, Bratmobile, Heavens to Betsy and Huggy Bear had split in 1994, Excuse 17 and most of the UK bands had split by 1995, and Bikini Kill and Emilys Sassy Lime released their last records in 1996. However, Team Dresch were active as late as 1998, The Gossip were active from 1999, Bratmobile reformed in 2000 and, perhaps most prolific of all, Sleater-Kinney were active - initially - from 1994 to 2006, releasing 7 albums.Many of the women involved in riot grrrl are still active in creating politically charged music. Kathleen Hanna went on to found the electro-feminist post-punk protest pop group Le Tigre and later The Julie Ruin, Kathi Wilcox joined The Casual Dots with Christina Billotte of Slant 6, and Tobi Vail formed Spider and the Webs. Corin Tucker of Heavens to Betsy and Carrie Brownstein of Excuse 17 co-founded Sleater-Kinney at the tail end of the original movement, and reformed the band again in 2014 after an 8-year hiatus, while Bratmobile reunited to release two albums, before Allison Wolfe began singing with other all-women bands, Cold Cold Hearts, and Partyline. Molly Neuman went on to play with New York punk band Love Or Perish and run her own indie label called Simple Social Graces Discos, as well as co-owning Lookout! Records and managing The Donnas, Ted Leo, Some Girls, and The Locust. Kaia Wilson of Team Dresch and multimedia artist Tammy Rae Carland went on to form the now-defunct Mr. Lady Records which released albums by The Butchies, The Need, Kiki and Herb, and Tracy + the Plastics.Feminism and riot grrrl culture.Riot grrrl culture is often associated with third wave feminism, which also grew rapidly during the same early nineties timeframe. The movement of third-wave feminism focused less on laws and the political process and more on individual identity. The movement of third-wave feminism is said to have arisen out of the realization that women are of many colors, ethnicities, nationalities, religions and cultural backgrounds. The riot grrrl movement allowed women their own space to create music and make political statements about the issues they were facing in the punk rock community and in society. They used their music and publications to express their views on issues such as patriarchy, double standards against women, rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment.An undated, typewritten Bikini Kill tour flier answers the question What is Riot grrrl? with: [Riot Grrrl is...] BECAUSE we girls want to create mediums that speak to US. We are tired of boy band after boy band, boy zine after boy zine, boy punk after boy punk after boy... BECAUSE we need to talk to each other. Communication/inclusion is the key. We will never know if we don\'t break the code of silence... BECAUSE in every form of media we see us/myself slapped, decapitated, laughed at, objectified, raped, trivialized, pushed, ignored, stereotyped, kicked, scorned, molested, silenced, invalidated, knifed, shot, choked and killed. BECAUSE a safe space needs to be created for girls where we can open our eyes and reach out to each other without being threatened by this sexist society and our day to day bullshit.Like other third wave feminists, riot grrrls attempted to foster an acceptance of diversity within feminist expression. That relationship to feminism is evident through their use of lyrics, zines and publications, and taking back the meaning of derogatory terms. All three of these forms were claimed to be a source of empowerment for women in the movement.The riot grrrl movement encouraged women to make their own place in a male-dominated punk scene. Punk shows had come to be understood as places where women could make their way to the front of the crowd into the mosh pit, but had to \'fight ten times harder\' because they were female, and sexually charged violence such as groping and rape had been reported.The vehemence fanzines large and small reserved for riot grrrl  and Bikini Kill in particular  was shocking. The punk zine editors\' use of \'bitches\', \'cunts\', \'man-haters\', and \'dykes\' was proof-positive that sexism was still strong in the punk scene.Kathleen Hanna would later write: It was also super schizo to play shows where guys threw stuff at us, called us cunts and yelled take it off during our set, and then the next night perform for throngs of amazing girls singing along to every lyric and cheering after every song.Many men were supporters of Riot grrrl culture and acts. Calvin Johnson and Slim Moon have been instrumental in publishing riot grrrl bands on the labels they founded, K Records and Kill Rock Stars respectively. Alec Empire of Atari Teenage Riot said, I was totally into the riot grrrl music, I see it as a very important form of expression. I learned a lot from that, way more maybe than from \'male\' punk rock. Dave Grohl and Kurt Cobain dated Kathleen Hanna and Tobi Vail (also respectively), and often played with Bikini Kill even after splitting with them; Kurt was a big fan of The Slits and even convinced The Raincoats to reform. He once said, The future of rock belongs to women. Many riot grrrl bands included male band members, such as Billy Karren of Bikini Kill or Jon Slade and Chris Rawley of Huggy Bear.Molly Neuman once summarized: We\'re not anti-boy, we\'re pro-girl.Riot grrrl concerts provided a safe haven for women, and often addressed issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality and female empowerment. For example, in Bikini Kill\'s Don\'t Need You, they sing: dont need you to say were cute/dont need you to say were alright/dont need your protection/dont need your kiss goodnight, rejecting stereotypical heterosexual relationship dynamics.Influenced heavily by DIY culture, most bands\' presentation subverted traditional or classically trained \'musicianship\' in favor of raw, primitive, avant-lo-fi passion and fiercely deliberate amateurism: an idea growing rapidly in popularity, especially in the Olympia music scene, with bands like Beat Happening coining the slogans: Learn how to NOT play your instrument and hey, you don\'t have to sound like the flavor of the month, all you have to do is sound like yourselves, arguing that traditional musical skill doesn\'t ultimately matter and should always be subservient to the passion, the fun and ideas in their music. This argument is similar to the ideological origins of punk rock itself, which started partially as an attempt to dissolve the growing division between audience and performer. These indie-punk bands (and riot grrrl bands in particular) were often ridiculed for not being able to play their instruments, but fans are quick to counter that identical criticisms were often faced by the first-wave of punk rock bands in the 1970s, and that this DIY garage amateurism play just \'cause you wanna, no matter what attitude was one of the most appealing and liberating aspects of both movements.Music.Other bands and artists associated with the riot grrrl movement in one way or another include - in the US - Slant 6, Sta-Prest, Sue P. Fox, Jenny Toomey, Adickdid, Tattle Tale, Jack Off Jill, The Need, Nomy Lamm, Lucid Nation, The Frumpies, Bangs, Crown for Athena, TummyAche, The Third Sex, Canopy, Cheesecake, Clever Boy (Annika Bentley) Growing Up Skipper, The Fucking Angels, Pagan Holiday, The Quails; in the UK, bands like Blood Sausage, Mambo Taxi, Voodoo Queens, Pussycat Trash, Golden Starlet, Witchknot, Frantic Spiders, Linus, Sister George, Lungleg, Sally Skull, Hello Skinny and Coping Saw (who featured Leeds fanzine writer Karren Ablaze); and in Brazil, bands like Dominatrix, Kaos Klitoriano and Menstruao Anarquika. In Tasmania, Australia - at the time a Conservative state that had not legalised sodomy  The Little Ugly Girls led by Linda J. Dacio identified with the riot grrrl movement. Letters between the band\'s drummer Sloth and Kathleen Hanna of Bikini Kill would soon see the bands share a stage in Hobart, Australia.There were also many girl-centric or all-women punk and queercore bands of this era, such as Calamity Jane, 7 Year Bitch, Red Aunts, Autoclave, Thee Headcoatees, Spitboy, Scissor Girls and Tribe 8, did not self-identify with the \'riot grrrl\' label, despite sharing similar DIY tactics and feminist ideologies.Media misconceptions.one huge misconception for instance that has been repeated over and over again in magazines we have never spoken to and also by those who believe these sources without checking things out themselves is that Bikini Kill is the definitive \'riot girl band\'... We are not in anyway \'leaders of\' or authorities on the \'Riot Girl\' movement. In fact, as individuals we have each had different experiences with, feelings on, opinions of and varying degrees of involvement with \'Riot Girl\' and though we totally respect those who still feel that label is important and meaningful to them, we have never used that term to describe ourselves AS A BAND. As individuals we respect and utilize and subscribe to a variety of different aesthetics, strategies, and beliefs, both political and punk-wise, some of which are probably considered \'riot girl.\'There were a lot of very important ideas that I think the mainstream media couldn\'t handle, so it was easier to focus on the fact that these were girls who were wearing barrettes in their hair or writing \'slut\' on their stomach.I think it was deliberate that we were made to look like we were just ridiculous girls parading around in our underwear. They refused to do serious interviews with us, they misprinted what we had to say, they would take our articles, and our fanzines, and our essays and take them out of context. We wrote a lot about sexual abuse and sexual assault for teenagers and young women. I think those are really important concepts that the media never addressed.Zines and publications.Even as the Seattle-area rock scene came to international mainstream media attention, riot grrrl remained a willfully underground phenomenon. Most musicians shunned the major record labels, devotedly working instead with indie labels such as Kill Rock Stars, K Records, Slampt, Piao! Records, Simple Machines, Catcall, WIIIJA and Chainsaw Records. The movement also figured fairly prominently in cassette culture, with artists often starting their own DIY cassette labels by as basic and spartan a means as recording their music onto cheap off-the-shelf boom-boxes and passing the cassettes out to friends, seldom charging anything beyond the cost of the actual tapes themselves.Riot grrrl\'s momentum was also hugely supported by an explosion of creativity in defiantly homemade cut-and-paste, xeroxed, collagey zines that covered a variety of feminist topics, frequently attempting to draw out the political implications of intensely personal experiences in a privately public space. Zines often described experiences with sexism, mental illness, body image and eating disorders, sexual abuse, racism, rape, discrimination, stalking, domestic violence, incest, homophobia, and sometimes vegetarianism. Grrrl zine editors are collectively engaged in forms of writing and writing instruction that challenge both dominant notions of the author as an individualized, bodiless space and notions of feminism as primarily an adult political project.When I think of how much benefit my teenage self could have gained from the multitude of zines that have proliferated over the past decade, I weep for all the lost potential. Except for Joan of Arc and Anne Frank, the thoughts of teenage girls have rarely been taken seriously.Bands would often attempt to reappropriate derogatory phrases like cunt, bitch, dyke, and slut, writing them proudly on their skin with lipstick or fat markers. Kathleen Hanna was writing slut on her stomach at shows as early as 1992, intentionally fusing feminist art and activist practices. Riot grrrls making political statements to reclaim phrases is a common theme among third-wave feminists. Not only did their music address the same issues as third-wave feminism, but they took a political stance against the oppression they were feeling.Many of the women involved with queercore were also interested in riot grrrl, and zines such as Chainsaw by Donna Dresch, Sister Nobody, Jane Gets A Divorce and I (heart) Amy Carter by Tammy Rae Carland embody both movements. There were also national conventions like in Washington, D.C., or the Pussystock festival in New York City, as well as various subsequent indie-documentaries like Don\'t Need You: the Herstory of Riot Grrrl.Starting during the fall of 2010, the Riot Grrrl Collection has been housed at New York University\'s Fales Library and Special Collections, as The Fales Riot Grrrl Collection. The collection\'s primary mandate is to collect unique materials that provide documentation of the creative process of individuals and the chronology of the [Riot Grrrl] movement overall. Kathleen Hanna, Johanna Fateman, and Becca Albee have donated primary source material, while Molly Neuman, Allison Wolfe, Kathi Wilcox, and Carrie Brownstein are expected to donate material shortly. The collection is the brainchild of Lisa Darms, Senior Archivist at the Fales Library. According to Jenna Freedman, a librarian who maintains a zine collection at Barnard College, It\'s just essential to preserve the activist voices in their own unmediated work, especially because of the media blackout that they called for. Kathleen Hanna, while understanding no collection can replicate the concert experience, feels the collection is a safe place that will be free from feminist erasure.Criticism.The Riot Grrrl movement has received criticism for not being inclusive enough. Riot Girls are often accused of being separatists: they want to form a life away from men and invent girl culture. One major argument is that the movement focuses on middle-class white women, alienating other kinds of women. This criticism emerged early in the movement. In 1993, Ramdasha Bikceem wrote in her zine, Gunk,Look, you\'ve got these highly intelligent imperious girls, but who told them it was their undeniable American right not to be offended? Being offended is part of being in the real world. I\'m offended every time I see George Bush on TV!Some have suggested that, while riot grrrl bands worked to ensure their shows were safe spaces in which women could find solidarity and create their own subculture, they have excluded trans women from events such as The Michigan\'s Womyn\'s Music Festival, which has a womyn born-womyn policy. Former members of Le Tigre have seen protests at shows for participating in the festival.Legacy.The legacy of riot grrrl is clearly visible in numerous girls and women worldwide who cite the movement as an interest or an influence on their lives and/or their work. Some of them are self-proclaimed riot grrrls while others consider themselves simply admirers or fans. There are many fansites and message boards for riot grrrl on the internet. In an age where Internet is the most accessible platform for individuals to express themselves, the Riot Grrrl online community has risen in popularity in recent years. Not only do these online platforms capture discussion regarding larger topics of systemic oppression, but they also provide space for girls to express smaller issuesthe successes and challenges of their everyday lives. It is a forum that allows for self-determined feminism and genuine, open expression, a core part of the Riot Grrrl message thats greatest power is giving girls the room to decide for themselves who they are. As both a purported musical genre and as a subculture, riot grrrl has been acclaimed as an influence on contemporary groups as varied as Kitten Forever, Skating Polly, The Shondes and The Ethical Debating Society.In the foreword to Riot Grrrl: Revolution Girl Style Now! Beth Ditto writes of riot grrrl,A movement formed by a handful of girls who felt empowered, who were angry, hilarious, and extreme through and for each other. Built on the floors of strangers\' living rooms, tops of Xerox machines, snail mail, word of mouth and mixtapes, riot grrrl reinvented punk.Writing about riot grrrl\'s personal influence on her and her music, she muses on the meaning of the movement for her generation, Until I found riot grrrl, or riot grrrl found me I was just another Gloria Steinem NOW feminist trying to take a stand in shop class. Now I am a musician, a writer, a whole person.Many women write to Hanna in hopes of reviving the Riot Grrrl Movement. Hanna says, Dont revive it, make something better. In 2010 Girls to the Front: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution, by Sara Marcus, was published. It is the first published history of the Riot Grrrl movement. Sara Marcus herself had attended Riot Grrrl meetings.

Intimate partner violence (IPV) is violence by a spouse or partner in an intimate relationship against the other spouse or partner. Domestic violence can take place in heterosexual and same-sex family relationships, and can involve violence against children in the family or, in some U.S. states, violence against a roommate. It also includes violence committed by children toward either parent and other siblings.Domestic violence can take a number of forms, including physical, verbal, emotional, economic, religious and sexual abuse, which can range from subtle, coercive forms to marital rape and to violent physical abuse such as female genital mutilation and acid throwing that results in disfigurement or death. Domestic murders include stoning, bride burning, honor killings and dowry deaths.Domestic violence affects men, women and children. In the United States, 35.6% of women and 28.5% of men have experienced some form of domestic violence (including rape, physical violence, or stalking) by an intimate partner in their lifetime. Globally, however, a wife or female partner is more commonly the victim of such violence. In some countries, particularly where there has been actual, or suspected infidelity by female partners, wife-beating is seen as justified by the majority of the population, and may be codified into law. Recent research has also shown there to be a direct and significant correlation between a country\'s level of gender equality, and actual rates of domestic violence. Both partners may also engage in abusive or violent behavior, or the victim may act in self-defense or retaliation. Whereas women who experience domestic violence, at least in the developed world, are often openly encouraged to report it to the authorities, it has been argued that domestic violence against men is most often unreported because of social norms and pressure against such reporting; those that do often face social stigma regarding their perceived lack of machismo and other denigrations of their masculinity.Domestic violence often occurs when the abuser believes that abuse is acceptable, justified, or unlikely to be reported. It may produce intergenerational cycles of abuse in children and other family members, who may feel that such violence is acceptable or condoned. Awareness, perception, definition and documentation of domestic violence differs widely from country to country. In abusive relationships, there may be a cycle of abuse during which tensions rise and an act of violence is committed, followed by a period of reconciliation and calm. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through isolation, power and control, cultural acceptance, lack of financial resources, fear, shame or to protect children. As a result of abuse, victims may experience physical disabilities, chronic health problems, mental illness, limited finances, and poor ability to create healthy relationships. Victims may experience psychological problems, such as post-traumatic stress disorder. Children who live in a household with violence often show psychological problems from an early age, such as dysregulated aggression which may later contribute to continuing the legacy of abuse when they reach adulthood. Domestic violence often happens in the context of forced or child marriage.Definitions.These terms are listed in order of increasing scope.Intimate partner violence.The term intimate partner violence (IPV) is often used synonymously with domestic abuse or domestic violence, but it usually refers to abuse occurring within a couple relation (marriage, cohabitation, though they do not have to live together for it to be considered domestic abuse).The World Health Organization (WHO) defines intimate partner violence as ... any behaviour within an intimate relationship that causes physical, psychological or sexual harm to those in the relationship.To these forms of abuse, the WHO adds controlling behaviors as a form of abuse.Intimate partner violence has been observed in heterosexual and same-sex relationships, and in the former instance by men against women and by women against men.Domestic violence.Traditionally, domestic violence (DV) was mostly associated with physical violence. For instance, according to the Merriam-Webster dictionary definition, domestic violence is: the inflicting of physical injury by one family or household member on another; also: a repeated / habitual pattern of such behavior. Domestic violence is now more broadly defined, often but not always including all acts of physical, sexual, psychological or economic violence that may be committed by a person who is a family member or a person that has been an intimate partner or spouse, irrespective of whether they lived together.Physical, sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including battering, sexual abuse of female children in the household, dowry-related violence, marital rape, female genital mutilation and other traditional practices harmful to women, non-spousal violence and violence related to exploitationFamily violence.Family violence is a broader term, often used to include child abuse, elder abuse, and other violent acts between family members.Child maltreatment, sometimes referred to as child abuse and neglect, includes all forms of physical and emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, and exploitation that results in actual or potential harm to the childs health, development or dignity. Within this broad definition, five subtypes can be distinguished  physical abuse; sexual abuse; neglect and negligent treatment; emotional abuse; and exploitation.Elder abuse is, according to the WHO: a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person.Forms.Domestic violence can take many forms, including physical aggression or assault (hitting, kicking, biting, shoving, restraining, slapping, throwing objects, battery), or threats thereof; sexual abuse; controlling or domineering; intimidation; stalking; passive/covert abuse (e.g., neglect); and economic deprivation. It can also mean endangerment, criminal coercion, kidnapping, unlawful imprisonment, trespassing, and harassment.Physical.Physical abuse is abuse involving contact intended to cause pain, injury, or other physical suffering or bodily harm. It includes hitting, slapping, punching, choking, pushing, throwing objects, burning and other types of contact that result in physical injury to the victim. The victim may be abused by several perpetrators: for instance the victim may be held down by a person so that someone else can assault the victim. The victim may be locked in a room or tied down.Acid attacks, also seen in domestic violence, occur when acid is thrown in anger or vengeance at the victims, usually at their faces, burning them, and damaging skin tissue, often exposing and sometimes dissolving the bones. This can result in long-term blindness and permanent scarring of the face and body.Denying the victim needed medical care, depriving them of sleep or other necessary functions, forcing the victim to engage in drug or alcohol use against their will, or creating any physical harm are forms of physical abuse. It can also include inflicting physical injury onto other targets, such as children or pets, in order to cause emotional harm to the victim.In recent years, strangulation in the context of DV has received significant attention. It is now recognized as one of the most lethal forms of DV; yet, because of the lack of external injuries, and the lack of social awareness and medical training in regard to it, strangulation has often been a rather hidden problem. As a result, in recent years, many US states have enacted specific laws against strangulation.Both women and men have been killed as the result of domestic violence. IPV homicide, however, makes up a greater proportion of all female homicides than it does male homicides. For instance, in the United Kingdom, 37 percent of murdered women were killed by an intimate partner and for men, 6 percent were killed by an intimate partner. From 40 to 70 percent of the women murdered in Canada, Australia, South Africa, Israel and the United States were killed by an intimate partner. The World Health Organization states that globally, about 38% of murders of women are committed by an intimate partner.In the Middle East and other parts of the world, planned domestic homicides, or honor killings, are carried out due to the belief of the perpetrators that the victim has brought dishonor upon the family or community. According to Human Rights Watch, honor killings are generally performed against women for refusing to enter into an arranged marriage, being the victim of a sexual assault, seeking a divorceeven from an abusive husbandor (allegedly) committing adultery, or exhibiting behavior perceived to have dishonored the family. In some parts of the world, where there is a strong social expectation for a woman to be a virgin prior to marriage, a bride may be subjected to extreme violence, including an honor killing, if she is deemed not to be a virgin on her wedding night due to the absence of blood.Bride burning or dowry killing is a form of domestic violence in which a newly married woman is killed at home by her husband or husband\'s family due to their dissatisfaction over the dowry provided by her family. The act is often a result of demands for more or prolonged dowry after the marriage. Dowry violence is most common in South Asia, especially in India. In 2011, the National Crime Records Bureau reported 8,618 dowry deaths in India, but unofficial figures estimate that there are at least three times more dowry deaths.Ritual scarification of children is practiced among various societies. Some view this practice as child abuse: for instance UNICEF considers ritual scarification of children as a harmful traditional practice.The dynamics of physical abuse in a relationship are often complex. Physical violence often occurs after a period of months or even years of other forms of abuse, such as threats, intimidation and controlling behaviors such as restrictions of the other person\'s self-determination, through isolation, manipulation and placing of limits on personal choices and freedoms.Sexual.Sexual violence, or sexual abuse, is defined by World Health Organization as any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, unwanted sexual comments or advances, or acts to traffic, or otherwise directed, against a persons sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim. It also includes obligatory inspections for virginity and female genital mutilation. Aside from initiation of the sexual act through physical force, sexual abuse occurs if a person is unable to understand the nature or condition of the act, unable to decline participation, or unable to communicate unwillingness to engage in the sexual act. This could be because of underage immaturity, illness, disability, or the influence of alcohol or other drugs, or due to intimidation or pressure.In many cultures, victims of rape are considered to have brought \'dishonour\' or \'disgrace\' to their families and face severe violence, including honor killings, from their families and relatives. This is especially the case if the victim becomes pregnant.Female genital mutilation is defined by the WHO as all procedures that involve partial or total removal of the external female genitalia, or other injury to the female genital organs for non-medical reasons. This procedure has been performed on more than 125 million females alive today, and it is concentrated in 29 countries in Africa and Middle East.Sexual abuse in the family can take the form of incest between an adult and a child, which is a form of child sexual abuse. In some cultures, there are ritualized forms of child sexual abuse that often take place with the knowledge and consent of the family of the child, where the child is induced to engage in sexual acts with adults, whether or not in exchange for money or goods: for instance in Malawi, some parents arrange for an older man, often called hyena, to have sex with their daughters The Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse is the first international treaty that addresses child sexual abuse that occurs within the home or family.Reproductive coercion (also called coerced reproduction) are threats or acts of violence against a partner\'s reproductive rights, health and decision-making; and includes a collection of behaviors intended to pressure or coerce a partner into becoming a parent or ending a pregnancy. Reproductive coercion is associated with forced sex, fear or inability of negotiating condom and contraceptive use, fear of violence after refusing sex, and abusive partner interference with access to healthcare.In some cultures, marriage imposes a social obligation on women to bear children. In northern Ghana, for example, payment of bride price signifies a woman\'s requirement to bear children, and women using birth control face substantial threats of violence and reprisals.The WHO includes customary forms of sexual violence, such as forced marriage or cohabitationand wife inheritance within its definition of sexual violence, as well as forced pregnancy. Wife inheritance, or levirate marriage, is a type of marriage in which the brother of a deceased man is obliged to marry his brother\'s widow, and the widow is obliged to marry her deceased husband\'s brother.Sexual violence also occurs between spouses or partners. Marital rape is non-consensual sexual intercourse or penetration perpetrated by a person against his or her spouse. Marital rape may be experienced through patterns of physical abuse, force, or demeaning sexual behavior by the perpetrator. It is under-reported, under-prosecuted, and is still legal in many countries, partly because of a myth that sex between married partners, whether consensual or not, cannot be rape. For centuries non-consensual sex in marriage was not considered a crime because it has been held historically that by marriage a woman gave irrevocable consent for her husband to have sex with her any time he demanded it. Feminists worked systematically since the 1960s to criminalize marital rape.In 2006, a study by the United Nations found that marital rape is a prosecutable offense in at least 104 countries Once widely condoned or ignored by law and society, marital rape is now repudiated by international conventions and increasingly criminalized. The countries which choose to ratify the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, the first legally binding instrument in Europe in the field of violence against women, are bound by its provisions to ensure that non-consensual sexual acts committed against a spouse or partner are illegal. The convention came into force in August 2014.Where marital rape is legal, or otherwise not prosecuted in practice, women are instructed before marriage that sex with the husband is their absolute duty, that they do not have the right to ever refuse it, and that it is considered the right of the husband to take it by force, if necessary. In Lebanon, for instance, while discussing a proposed law that would criminalize marital rape, Sheik Ahmad Al-Kurdi, a judge in the Sunni religious court, said that the law could lead to the imprisonment of the man where in reality he is exercising the least of his marital rights.Emotional.Emotional abuse (also called psychological abuse or mental abuse) can include verbal abuse and is defined as any behavior that threatens, intimidates, undermines the victims self-worth or self-esteem, or controls the victims freedom. According to the Istanbul Convention, psychological violence is the intentional conduct of seriously impairing a persons psychological integrity through coercion or threats.Emotional abuse can include threatening the victim with injury or harm, telling the victim that they will be killed if they ever leave the relationship, isolating them from others, and public humiliation. Controlling behavior includes monitoring the victim\'s movements, or restricting their access to financial resources, employment, education or medical care. Constant criticism, devaluing statements, and name-calling are emotionally abusive behaviors. It may also include conflicting actions or statements which are designed to confuse and create insecurity in the victim. These behaviors also lead the victims to question themselves, causing them to believe that they are making up the abuse or that the abuse is their fault. Perpetrators may alienate a child from a parent or extended family member by teaching or forcing them to harshly criticize another person. Stalking is a common form of psychological intimidation, and is most often perpetrated by former or current partners.People who are being emotionally abused may feel that their significant other has nearly total control over them. Isolation damages the victim\'s sense of internal strength, leaving them feeling helpless and unable to escape from the situation. Victims often suffer from depression, which puts them at increased risk of eating disorders, suicide, and drug and alcohol abuse.Verbal.Verbal abuse is a form of emotionally abusive behavior involving the use of language, which can involve threats, name-calling, blaming, ridicule, disrespect, and criticism. Less obviously aggressive forms of verbal abuse include statements that may seem benign on the surface that are thinly veiled attempts to humiliate, falsely accuse, or manipulate others to submit to undesirable behavior, make others feel unwanted and unloved, threaten others economically, or isolate victims from support systems.Economic.Economic abuse is a form of abuse when one intimate partner has control over the other partner\'s access to economic resources. Economic abuse may involve preventing a spouse from resource acquisition, limiting the amount of resources to use by the victim, or by exploiting economic resources of the victim. The motive behind preventing a spouse from acquiring resources is to diminish the victim\'s capacity to support his/herself, thus forcing him/her to depend on the perpetrator financially, which includes preventing the victim from obtaining education, finding employment, maintaining or advancing their careers, and acquiring assets. Forcing or pressuring a family member to sign documents, to sell things, or to change a will are forms of economic abuse.In addition, the abuser may also put the victim on an allowance, closely monitor how the victim spends money, spend victim\'s money without his/her consent and creating debt, or completely spend victim\'s savings to limit available resources When an allowance is broken or there is a disagreement about the justification for any money spent, the abuser may punish the victim with physical, sexual or emotional abuse.In parts of the world where women depend on husbands in order to survive (due to lack of opportunities for female employment and lack of state welfare) economic abuse can have very severe consequences. Abusive relations have been associated with malnutrition among both mothers and children. In India, for example, the withholding of food is a documented form of family abuse.Parental abuse of children (child abuse).Child abuse is the physical, sexual or emotional maltreatment or neglect of a child or children. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department for Children and Families (DCF) define child maltreatment as any act or series of acts of commission or omission by a parent or other caregiver that results in harm, potential for harm, or threat of harm to a child. Child abuse can occur in a child\'s home, or in the organizations, schools or communities the child interacts with. There are four major categories of child abuse: neglect, physical abuse, psychological or emotional abuse, and sexual abuse.Parental abuse by children.According to Family Lives, a UK-based nonprofit organization, abuse of parents by their children is a common but under-reported and under-researched subject. They say that parents are quite often subject to levels of childhood aggression in excess of normal childhood aggressive outbursts, typically in the form of verbal or physical abuse, and that parents feel a sense of shame and humiliation to have that problem, so they rarely seek help.Elder abuse.Elder abuse is a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust, which causes harm or distress to an older person. This definition has been adopted by the World Health Organization from a definition put forward by Action on Elder Abuse in the UK. Laws protecting the elderly from abuse are similar to, and related to, laws protecting dependent adults from abuse.The core element to the harm of elder abuse is the expectation of trust of the older person toward their abuser. Thus, it includes harms by people the older person knows or with whom they have a relationship, such as a spouse, partner or family member, a friend or neighbor, or people that the older person relies on for services. Many forms of elder abuse are recognized as types of domestic violence or family violence.General.The relationship between gender and domestic violence is a controversial topic. There continues to be debate about the rates at which each gender is subjected to domestic violence. Reasons for mixed findings include the limitations of existing survey tools (e.g., conflict tactics scale) to measure all relevant aspects of domestic violence and the use of disparate samples in studies. A problem in conducting studies that seek to describe violence in terms of gender is the amount of silence, fear and shame that results from abuse within families and relationships. Because there are different viewpoints about what constitutes domestic violence, it is difficult to compile study results. In addition, people who have experienced subtle forms of abuse or have lived through patterns of abuse over many years begin to see it as normal.Gender differences in reporting violence have been cited as another explanation for mixed results. A 2011 review article by IPV researcher Ko Ling Chan found evidence of gender-specific reporting patterns: men tended to under-report their own perpetration of domestic violence while women were more likely to under-report their victimization. Factors which according to the reviewed studies can lead women to under-report their partner\'s violence include financial or familial dependence on the abusive partner, the tendency to excuse or normalize the partner\'s violence with the reasoning that their partner really loves them, and self-blaming. By contrast, men who under-report their own violence may be influenced by the fear and avoidance of legal consequences, the tendency to blame their partner, and a narrative focus on their needs and emotions during reporting. Furthermore, cultural factors can influence men\'s under-reporting of their own violence. In cultures where machismo is prevalent and where men are considered the head of households in control of their family, wife battering may be not perceived as a serious behavior that needs to be reported.Some authors have criticized the gender-based approach of domestic violence, which heavily focuses on women as victims of domestic violence. A 2013 review, which acknowledges that its definition of domestic violence is not the mainstream view, defining partner abuse broadly to include emotional abuse, any kind of hitting, and who hits first, examined studies from five continents and the correlation between a country\'s level of gender inequality and rates of domestic violence; the authors stated that if one looks at who is physically harmed and how seriously, who expresses more fear, who has psychological problems following abuse, domestic violence is significantly gendered and women suffer the most; however, going by their broader paradigm, partner abuse can no longer be conceived as merely a gender problem, but also (and perhaps primarily) as a human and relational problem, and should be framed as such, by everyone concerned. In an effort to shift consciousness about the connections between gender and abuse, many organizations have made an effort to use gender-neutral terms when referring to perpetratorship and victimhood. For instance, broader terms like family violence are used rather than violence against women.A 2011 review by researcher Chan Ko Ling from the University of Hong Kong on both Western and Asian studies on domestic violence found that minor partner violence was equal for both men and women but more severe partner violence was more likely to be perpetrated by men. His analysis found that men were more likely to beat up, choke or strangle their partners while women were more likely to throw something at their partner, slap, kick, bite, punch, or hit with an object. Researchers have also found different outcomes in men and women in response to intimate partner violence. A 2012 review from the journal Psychology of Violence found that women suffered disproportionately as a result of IPV especially in terms of injuries, fear, and posttraumatic stress. The review also found that 70% of female victims in their in one study were very frightened in response to intimate partner violence from their partners, but 85% of male victims endorsed no fear. The review also found that IPV mediated the satisfaction of the relationship for women but it did not do so for men.Violence against women.One of the most prevalent human rights violations in the world is violence against women and girls. The United Nations Population Fund says that, Worldwide one in three women will experience physical or sexual abuse in her lifetime.Wife beating was made illegal in all states of the United States by 1920. Although the exact rates are widely disputed, especially within the United States, there is a large body of cross-cultural evidence that women are subjected to domestic violence significantly more often than men. In addition, there is broad consensus that women are more often subjected to severe forms of abuse and are more likely to be injured by an abusive partner. The situation can be exacerbated if the woman is economically or socially dependent on the offender.The United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women (1993) states that violence against women is a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women, which has led to domination over and discrimination against women by men and to the prevention of the full advancement of women, and that violence against women is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position compared with men.The Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women classifies violence against women into three categories: that occurring in the family (DV), that occurring within the general community, and that perpetrated or condoned by the State.The Inter-American Convention on the Prevention, Punishment, and Eradication of Violence against Women defines violence against women as any act or conduct, based on gender, which causes death or physical, sexual or psychological harm or suffering to women, whether in the public or the private sphere. Similarly with the Declaration on the Elimination of Violence against Women, it classifies VAW into three categories; one of which being DV - defined as VAW which takes place within the family or domestic unit or within any other interpersonal relationship, whether or not the perpetrator shares or has shared the same residence with the woman.The Maputo Protocol has a broader definition, it defines VAW as: all acts perpetrated against women which cause or could cause them physical, sexual, psychological, and economic harm, including the threat to take such acts; or to undertake the imposition of arbitrary restrictions on or deprivation of fundamental freedoms in private or public life in peace time and during situations of armed conflicts or of war.Violence against women is increasingly considered not only a human rights violation, but also a form of discrimination against women. The Istanbul Convention states: violence against women is understood as a violation of human rights and a form of discrimination against women (...). (Article 3  Definitions). In the landmark case of Opuz v Turkey, the European Court of Human Rights held for the first time that gender-based domestic violence is a form of discrimination under the European Convention.Femicide is usually defined as the gender-based killing of women by men, although the exact definitions vary. Femicides often occur in the context of DV, such as honor killings or dowry killings. For statistical purposes, femicide is often defined as any killing of a woman. The top countries by rate of femicide are El Salvador, Jamaica, Guatemala, South Africa and Russia (data from 200409). However, in El Salvador and Colombia, which have a very high rate of femicide, only three percent of all femicides are committed by a current or former intimate partner, while in Cyprus, France, and Portugal former and current partners are responsible for more than 80% of all cases of femicide.Pregnancy.During pregnancy a woman may begin to be abused or long-standing abuse may change in severity, which may have negative health affects to the mother and fetus. Pregnancy can also lead to a hiatus of domestic violence when the abuser does not want to harm the unborn child. The risk of domestic violence for women who have been pregnant is greatest immediately after childbirth.In Russia, pregnancy of the victim is an aggravation, while pregnancy of the offender is a mitigation.Violence against men.Domestic violence against men is abuse against men or boys in an intimate heterosexual or homosexual relationship. It can include physical, emotional and sexual forms of abuse. Signs of abuse may be difficult to anticipate initially in a relationship and may begin as the relationship grows increasingly controlling. An abusive relationship may involve mutual violence or require a man to leave with his children if his wife or partner is abusive to their children.Determining how many instances of domestic violence actually involve male victims is difficult. Male domestic violence victims may be reluctant to get help for various reasons. One study investigated whether women who assaulted their male partners were more likely to avoid arrest even when the male victim contacts police. The study found that, In general, the evidence does not support the idea that the response of the courts depends on the gender of the offender or victim. Another study examined the differences in how male and female batterers were treated by the criminal justice system. The study states that, data provides some support for qualitative research suggesting that court personnel are responsive to the gendered asymmetry of intimate partner violence, and may view female intimate violence perpetrators more as victims than offenders.Adolescents and young adults.IPV is common among adolescent and young adult populations. Among adolescents, researchers have primarily focused on Caucasian youth, and there are yet no studies which focus specifically on IPV in adolescent same-sex romantic relationships. The literature indicates that the rates are similar for the number of girls and boys in heterosexual relationships who report experiencing IPV, or that girls in heterosexual relationships are more likely than their male counterparts to report perpetrating IPV. Ely et al. stated that, unlike domestic violence in general, equal rates of IPV perpetration is a unique characteristic with regard to adolescent dating violence, and that this is perhaps because the period of adolescence, a special developmental state, is accompanied by sexual characteristics that are distinctly different from the characteristics of adult. Wekerle and Wolfe theorized that a mutually coercive and violent dynamic may form during adolescence, a time when males and females are more equal on a physical level and that this physical equality allows girls to assert more power through physical violence than is possible for an adult female attacked by a fully physically mature man.Although the literature indicates that both genders engage in IPV at about equal rates, females are more likely to use less dangerous forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males are more likely to punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males are also more likely to use sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are four times more likely to respond as having experienced rape and are also more likely to suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse; they generally take IPV more seriously than their male counterparts, who are more likely to shrug off female-perpetrated IPV. Along with form, motivations for violence also vary by gender: females are likely to perpetrate violence in self-defense, while males are likely to perpetrate violence to exert power or control. The self-defense aspect is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males. Other research indicates that boys who have been abused in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who have been abused in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and self-efficacy; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration and victimization among adolescents vary and are not well understood.Same-sex relationships.Historically, domestic violence has been seen as a heterosexual family issue and little interest has been directed at violence in same-sex relationships, but domestic violence can occur in same-sex relationships as well. The Encyclopedia of Victimology and Crime Prevention states, For several methodological reasons nonrandom sampling procedures and self-selection factors, among others it is not possible to assess the extent of same-sex domestic violence. Studies on abuse between gay male or lesbian partners usually rely on small convenience samples such as lesbian or gay male members of an association.Some sources state that gay and lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples, while other sources state domestic violence among gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals might be higher than among heterosexual individuals, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that lesbian couples experience domestic violence less than heterosexual couples do. One study focusing on Hispanic men indicated that gay men are less likely to have been perpetrators or victims of domestic violence than heterosexual men but that bisexual men are more likely to have been both. By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.A 1999 analysis of nineteen studies of partner abuse concluded that [r]esearch suggests that lesbians and gay men are just as likely to abuse their partners as heterosexual men. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released the 2010 results of their National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey and report that 44% of lesbian women, 61% of bisexual women, and 35% of heterosexual women experienced domestic violence in their lifetime. This same report states that 26% of gay men, 37% of bisexual men, and 29% of heterosexual men experienced domestic violence in their lifetime. A 2013 study showed that 40.4% of self-identified lesbians and 56.9% of bisexual women have reported being victims of partner violence. In 2014, national surveys indicated that anywhere from 25-50% of gay and bisexual males have experienced physical violence from a partner.Gay and lesbian relationships have been identified as a risk factor for abuse in certain populations. LGBT people in some parts of the world have very little legal protection from DV, because engaging in homosexual acts is itself prohibited by the sodomy laws of those jurisdictions (as of 2014, same-sex sexual acts are punishable by imprisonment in 70 countries and by death in other 5 countries) and these legal prohibitions prevent LGBT victims of DV from reporting the abuse to authorities. In the face of the 2003 Supreme Court decision, 13 US states have refused to remove sodomy laws from legislation as of 2013.People in same-sex relationships face special obstacles in dealing with the issues that some researchers have labeled the double closet. A 1997 Canadian study by Mark W. Lehman suggests similarities include frequency (approximately one in every four couples); manifestations (emotional, physical, financial, etc.); co-existent situations (unemployment, substance abuse, low self-esteem); victims\' reactions (fear, feelings of helplessness, hypervigilance); and reasons for staying (love, can work it out, things will change, denial). Studies conducted by Emory University in 2014 identified 24 trigger for partner violence through web-based surveys, ranging from drugs and alcohol to safe-sex discussions. A general theme of power and control seems to underlie abuse in both heterosexual and homosexual relationships.At the same time, significant differences, unique issues, and deceptive myths are typically present. Lehman, regarding his 1997 survey, points to added discrimination and fears that gay and lesbian individuals may face. This includes potential dismissal by police and some social services, a lack of support from peers, fear of attracting negative stigma toward the gay community, the impact of AIDS status in keeping partners together (due to health care insurance/access, or guilt), threat of outing, and encountering supportive services that are targeted, or structured for the needs of heterosexual women, and may not meet the needs of gay men or lesbians. This service structure can make LGBTQ victims feel even more isolated and misunderstood than they may already because of their minority status. Lehman, however, stated that due to the limited number of returned responses and non-random sampling methodology the findings of this work are not generalizable beyond the sample of 32 initial respondents and final 10 who completed the more in-depth survey. Particularly, sexual stressors and HIV/AIDS status have emerged as significant differences in same-sex partner violence.Cycle of abuse.Lenore E. Walker presented the model of a Cycle of abuse which consists of four phases. First, there is a buildup to abuse when tension rises until a domestic violence incident ensues. During the reconciliation stage, the abuser may be kind and loving and then there is a period of calm. When the situation is calm, the abused person may be hopeful that the situation will change. Then, tensions begin to build, and the cycle starts again.Other.Others, such as the US Centers for Disease Control, divide domestic violence into two types: reciprocal, in which both partners are violent, and non-reciprocal violence, in which one partner is violent.Under-reporting.Incidents of DV are often under-reported to authorities. A 2014 study conducted across the 28 member states of the European Union found that only 14% of women reported their most serious incident of intimate partner violence to the police. A 2009 report on DV in Northern Ireland found that under-reporting is a concern and domestic abuse is the least likely of all violent crimes to be reported to the police.Social views.Social views on domestic violence vary from person to person, and from region to region, but in many places outside the West, the concept is very poorly understood. This is because in most of these countries the relation between the husband and wife is not considered one of equals, but instead one in which the wife must submit herself to the husband. This is codified in the laws of some countries  for example, in Yemen, marriage regulations state that a wife must obey her husband and must not leave home without his permission.According to Violence against Women in Families and Relationships: Globally, wife-beating is seen as justified in some circumstances by a majority of the population in various countries, most commonly in situations of actual or suspected infidelity by wives or their disobedience toward a husband or partner. These violent acts against a wife are often not considered a form of abuse by society (both men and women) but are considered to have been provoked by the behavior of the wife, who is seen as being at fault. While beatings of wives are often a response to inappropriate behaviors, in many places extreme acts such as honor killings are approved by a high section of the society. In one survey, 33.4% of teenagers in Jordan\'s capital city, Amman, approved of honor killings. This survey was carried in the capital of Jordan, which is much more liberal than other parts of the country; the researchers said that We would expect that in the more rural and traditional parts of Jordan, support for honor killings would be even higher.In a 2012 news story, The Washington Post reported, The Reuters TrustLaw group named India one of the worst countries in the world for women this year, partly because domestic violence there is often seen as deserved. A 2012 report by UNICEF found that 57 percent of Indian boys and 53 percent of girls between the ages of 15 and 19 think wife-beating is justified.In conservative cultures, a wife dressing in attire deemed insufficiently modest can suffer serious violence at the hands of her husband or relatives, with such violent responses seen as appropriate by most of the society: in a survey, 62.8% of women in Afghanistan said that a husband is justified in beating his wife if she wears inappropriate clothes.In some developing countries, practices that subjugate and harm women - such as wife-beating, killings in the name of honour, female genital mutilation/cutting and dowry deaths - are condoned as being part of the natural order of things.Strong views among the population in certain societies that reconciliation is more appropriate than punishment in cases of domestic violence are also another cause of legal impunity; a study found that 64% of public officials in Colombia said that if it were in their hands to solve a case of intimate partner violence, the action they would take would be to encourage the parties to reconcile.Victim blaming is also prevalent in many societies, including in Western countries: a 2010 Eurobarometer poll found that 52% of respondents agreed with the assertion that the provocative behaviour of women was a cause of violence against women; with respondents in Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta and Slovenia being most likely to agree with the assertion (more than 70% in each of these countries).Religion.There is controversy regarding the influence of religion on domestic violence. According to Domestic Violence Cross Cultural Perspective: No religion sanctions violence against women, but there are some religious scriptures that have been taken out of context to support discrimination against women within a community.Judaism, Christianity and Islam have traditionally supported male-dominant households and socially sanctioned violence against women has been persistent since ancient times.The Catholic Church has been criticized for opposing divorce, and therefore trapping victims of violence in abusive marriages.At the same time, religious leaders can play an important role in preventing and treating domestic violence, when they provide abusers with guidance and treatment option information, and offer their support to those who have been subject to abuse.Views on the influence of religion on domestic violence differ. While some authors, such as Phyllis Chesler, argue that Islam is connected to violence against women, especially in the form of honor killings, others, such as Tahira Shahid Khan, a professor specializing in women\'s issues at the Aga Khan University in Pakistan, argue that it is the domination of men and inferior status of women in society that lead to these acts, not the religion itself. Public (such as through the media) and political discourse debating the relation between Islam, immigration, and violence against women is highly controversial in many Western countries.Custom and tradition.Local customs and traditions are often responsible for maintaining certain forms of DV. Such customs and traditions include son preference (the desire of a family to have a boy and not a girl, which is strongly prevalent in parts of Asia), which can lead to abuse and neglect of girl children by disappointed family members; child and forced marriages; dowry; the hierarchic caste system which stigmatizes lower castes and untouchables, leading to discrimination and restricted opportunities of the females and thus making them more vulnerable to abuse; strict dress codes for women that may be enforced through violence by family members; strong requirement of female virginity before the wedding and violence related to non-conforming women and girls; taboos about menstruation leading to females being isolated and shunned during the time of menstruation; female genital mutilation (FGM); ideologies of marital \'conjugal rights\' to sex which justify marital rape; the importance given to \'family honor\'.According to a 2003 report by Human Rights Watch, Customs such as the payment of \'bride price\' (payment made by a man to the family of a woman he wishes to marry), whereby a man essentially purchases his wifes sexual favors and reproductive capacity, underscore mens socially sanctioned entitlement to dictate the terms of sex, and to use force to do so.In recent years, there has been progress in the area of addressing customary practices that endanger women, with laws being enacted in several countries. The Inter-African Committee on Traditional Practices Affecting the Health of Women and Children is an NGO which works on changing social values, raising consciousness, and enacting laws against harmful traditions which affect the health of women and children in Africa. Laws were also enacted in some countries; for example the 2004 Criminal Code of Ethiopia has a chapter on harmful traditional practices  Chapter III  Crimes committed against life, person and health through harmful traditional practices. In addition, the Council of Europe adopted a convention which addresses domestic violence and violence against women, and calls for the states which ratify it to create and fully adjudicate laws against acts of violence previously condoned by traditional, culture, custom, in the name of honor, or to correct what is deemed unacceptable behavior. The United Nations created the Handbook on effective police responses to violence against women to provide guidelines to address and manage violence through the creation of effective laws, law enforcement policies and practices and community activities to break down societal norms that condone violence, criminalize it and create effect support systems for survivors of violence.In cultures where the police and legal authorities have a reputation of corruption and abusive practices, victims of DV are often reluctant to turn to formal help.Relation to forced and child marriage.A forced marriage is a marriage where one or both participants are married without their freely given consent. In many parts of the world, it is often difficult to draw a line between \'forced\' and \'consensual\' marriage: in many cultures (especially in South Asia, the Middle East and parts of Africa), marriages are prearranged, often as soon a girl is born; the idea of a girl going against the wishes of her family and choosing herself her own future husband is not socially accepted  there is no need to use threats or violence to force the marriage, the future bride will submit because she simply has no other choice. As in the case of child marriage, the customs of dowry and bride price contribute to this phenomenon. A child marriage is a marriage where one or both parties are younger than 18.Forced and child marriages are associated with a high rate of domestic violence. These types of marriages are related to violence both in regard to the spousal violence perpetrated inside marriage, and in regard to the violence related to the customs and traditions of these marriage: violence and trafficking related to the payment of dowry and bride price, honor killings for refusing the marriage.UNFPA states, Despite near-universal commitments to end child marriage, one in three girls in developing countries (excluding China) will probably be married before they are 18. One out of nine girls will be married before their 15th birthday. UNFPA estimates, Over 67 million women 20-24 year old in 2010 had been married as girls, half of which were in Asia, and one-fifth in Africa. UNFPA says that, In the next decade 14.2 million girls under 18 will be married every year; this translates into 39,000 girls married each day and this will rise to an average of 15.1 million girls a year, starting in 2021 until 2030, if present trends continue.HIV/AIDS.There is a compelling case to end intimate partner violence both in its own right as well as to reduce women and girls vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. The evidence on the linkages between violence against women and HIV/AIDS highlights that there are direct and indirect mechanisms by which the two interact.Same-sex relationships are similarly affected by HIV/AIDS status in domestic violence. Research by Heintz and Melendez found that same-sex individuals may have difficulty breaching the topic of safe-sex for reasons such as decreased perception of control over sex, fear of violence, and unequal power distributions... Of those who reported violence in the study, about 50% reported forced sexual experiences, of which only half reported the use of safe sex measures. Barriers to safer-sex included fear of abuse, and deception in safe-sex practices. Heintz and Melendez\'s research ultimately concluded that sexual assault/abuse in same-sex relationships provides a major concern for HIV/AIDS infection as it decreases instances of safe-sex. Furthermore, these incidents create additional fear and stigma surrounding safe-sex conversations and knowing ones STD status.Legislation.Lack of adequate legislation which criminalizes domestic violence, or, alternatively legislation which prohibits consensual behaviors, may hinder the progress in regard to reducing the incidence of DV. Amnesty Internationals Secretary General has stated that: It is unbelievable that in the twenty-first century some countries are condoning child marriage and marital rape while others are outlawing abortion, sex outside marriage and same-sex sexual activity  even punishable by death. According to WHO, one of the most common forms of violence against women is that performed by a husband or male partner. The WHO notes that such violence is often ignored because often legal systems and cultural norms do not treat as a crime, but rather as a \'private\' family matter, or a normal part of life. The criminalization of adultery has been cited as inciting violence against women, as these prohibitions are often meant, in law or in practice, to control women\'s and not men\'s behavior; and are used to rationalize acts of violence against women. According to High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay: Some have argued, and continue to argue, that family violence is placed outside the conceptual framework of international human rights. However, under international laws and standards, there is a clear State responsibility to uphold womens rights and ensure freedom from discrimination, which includes the responsibility to prevent, protect and provide redress  regardless of sex, and regardless of a persons status in the family.Ability to leave an abusive relationship.The ability of victims of DV to leave the violent relationship is crucial for preventing further abuse. In traditional communities, divorced women often feel rejected and ostracized. In order to avoid this stigma, many women prefer to remain in the marriage and endure the abuse. Discriminatory marriage and divorce laws can also play a role in the proliferation of DV. According to Rashida Manjoo, UN Special Rapporteur on violence against women: [...] in many countries a womans access to property hinges on her relationship to a man. When she separates from her husband or when he dies, she risks losing her home, land, household goods and other property. Failure to ensure equal property rights upon separation or divorce discourages women from leaving violent marriages, as women may be forced to choose between violence at home and destitution in the street. The legal inability to obtain a divorce (due to complicated grounds for divorce in countries which do not accept no fault divorce) is also a factor in the proliferation of DV. In some cultures where marriages are arranged between families, a woman who attempts a separation or divorce without the consent of her husband and extended family/relatives may risk being subjected to \'honor\' based violence. The custom of bride price also makes leaving a marriage more difficult: if the wife wants to leave, the husband may demand back the bride price from her family (who often cannot or does not want to pay it back). Even in more modern communities, lack of awareness of the law can result in victims of DV remaining in the marriage. In 1996, the United States Congress passed the Violence Against Women Act, or VAWA. Under this Act, a number of protective measures are afforded to DV victims.Individual versus family unit rights.The way the individual rights of a family member versus the rights of the family as a unit are balanced vary significantly in different societies. This may influence the degree to which a government may be willing to investigate family incidents. In some cultures, individual members of the family are expected to sacrifice almost completely their own interests in favor of the interests of the family as a whole. What is viewed as an undue expression of personal autonomy is condemned as unacceptable. In these cultures the family predominates over the individual, and where this interacts with cultures of honor, individualistic choice that may damage the family reputation in the community may result in extreme punishment, such as honor killings.Immigration policies.In some countries, the immigration policy is tied to whether the person desiring citizenship is married to his/her sponsor. This can lead to persons being trapped in violent relations - such persons may risk deportation if they attempt to separate (they may be accused of having entered into a sham marriage). Often the women come from cultures where they will suffer disgrace from their families if they abandon their marriage and return home, and so they prefer to stay married, therefore reamaing locked in a cycle of abuse.Alcohol abuse.Alcohol consumption and mental illness can be co-morbid with abuse.Immigrant communities.Domestic violence may happen in immigrant communities, and often there is little awareness in these communities of the laws and policies of the host country. A study among first generation South Asians in the UK found that they had little knowledge about what constituted criminal behavior under the English law. The researchers found that There was certainly no awareness that there could be rape within a marriage. A study in Australia showed that among the immigrant women sampled who were abused by partners and did not report it, 16.7% did not know DV was illegal, while 18.8% did not know that they could get protection.Causes.The causes of domestic violence are not made clear through research, but there are several factors that can result in violence. One of the most important is a belief that abuse, whether physical or verbal, is acceptable. Related to that, growing up in a violent home or living within a culture that accepts domestic violence are factors. Other factors are substance abuse, unemployment, psychological problems, poor coping skills, isolation, and excessive dependence on the abuser.Intergenerational cycle of violence.A common aspect among abusers is that they witnessed abuse in their childhood, in other words they were participants in a chain of intergenerational cycles of domestic violence. That does not mean, conversely, that if a child witnesses or is subject to violence that they will become abusers. Understanding and breaking the intergenerational abuse patterns may do more to reduce domestic violence than other remedies for managing the abuse.Responses that focus on children suggest that experiences throughout life influence an individuals\' propensity to engage in family violence (either as a victim or as a perpetrator). Researchers supporting this theory suggest it is useful to think of three sources of domestic violence: childhood socialization, previous experiences in couple relationships during adolescence, and levels of strain in a person\'s current life. People who observe their parents abusing each other, or who were themselves abused may incorporate abuse into their behaviour within relationships that they establish as adults.Physical punishment of children has also been linked to later domestic violence. According to Elizabeth Gershoff at the University of Michigan, research indicates that the more corporal punishment children receive, the more likely they are as adults to act violently towards family members, including intimate partners. The American Academy of Pediatrics comments that children who are spanked more as children are more likely as adults to approve of hitting a partner, and also experience more marital conflict and feelings of anger in general. According to Joan Durrant at the University of Manitoba, a number of studies have found physical punishment to be associated with higher levels of aggression against parents, siblings, peers and spouses, even when controlling for other factors. While these associations do not prove causation, a number of longitudinal studies suggest that the experience of physical punishment has a direct causal effect on later aggressive behaviors. In addition, physical abuse of children most often occurs in the context of punishment.Daughter in law/mother in law cycle of violence.In some patrilineal societies around the world, a young bride moves with the family of her husband. As a new girl in the home, she starts as having the lowest (or among the lowest) position in the family, and is often subjected to violence and abuse, and is, in particular, strongly controlled by the parents-in-law: with the arrival of the daughter-in-law in the family, the mother-in-law\'s status is elevated and she now has (often for the first time in her life) substantial power over someone else, and This family system itself tends to produce a cycle of violence in which the formerly abused bride becomes the abusing mother-in-law to her new daughter-in-law. Amnesty International writes that, in Tajikistan, it is almost an initiation ritual for the mother-in-law to put her daughter-in-law through the same torments she went through herself as a young wife.Biological and psychological.These factors include genetics and brain dysfunction and are studied by neuroscience. Psychological theories focus on personality traits and mental characteristics of the offender. Personality traits include sudden bursts of anger, poor impulse control, and poor self-esteem. Various theories suggest that psychopathology and other personality disorders are factors, and that abuse experienced as a child leads some people to be more violent as adults. Correlation has been found between juvenile delinquency and domestic violence in adulthood. Studies have found high incidence of psychopathy among abusers. For instance, some research suggests that about 80% of both court-referred and self-referred men in these domestic violence studies exhibited diagnosable psychopathology, typically personality disorders. The estimate of personality disorders in the general population would be more in the 1520% range [...] As violence becomes more severe and chronic in the relationship, the likelihood of psychopathology in these men approaches 100%.Dutton has suggested a psychological profile of men who abuse their wives, arguing that they have borderline personalities that are developed early in life.However, these psychological theories are disputed: Gelles suggests that psychological theories are limited, and points out that other researchers have found that only 10% (or less) fit this psychological profile. He argues that social factors are important, while personality traits, mental illness, or psychopathy are lesser factors.Psychiatric disorders are sometimes associated with domestic violence, such as borderline personality disorder, antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, drug abuse, and alcoholism. It is estimated that at least one-third of all abusers have some type of mental illness.Many cases of domestic violence arise from the jealousy felt by one partner that they suspect their partner of being unfaithful or is planning to leave the relationship. Besides jealousy, the other partner may feel insulted by the rejection, which impacts on their self-esteem. An evolutionary psychological explanation of such cases of domestic violence against a woman is that they represent male attempts to control female reproduction and ensure sexual exclusivity through violence or the threat of violence. Though often jealousy is used as an excuse for the abusers behavior, most often it is just an excuse in order to exert more control over their partner and a blaming technique in order to isolate the victim further from friends and family. Violence related to extramarital relations is seen as justified in certain parts of the world. For instance, a survey in Diyarbakir, Turkey, found that, when asked the appropriate punishment for a woman who has committed adultery, 37% of respondents said she should be killed, while 21% said her nose or ears should be cut off.Similar feelings may at times be generated in a situation where one partner is doing better than the other, for example, when the woman is more successful than the husband.Behavioral.Behavioral theories draw on the work of behavior analysts. Applied behavior analysis uses the basic principles of learning theory to change behavior. Behavioral theories of domestic violence focus on the use of functional assessment with the goal of reducing episodes of violence to zero rates. This program leads to behavior therapy. Often by identifying the antecedents and consequences of violent action, the abusers can be taught self control. Recently more focus has been placed on prevention and a behavioral prevention theory.General.Social theories look at external factors in the offender\'s environment, such as family structure, stress, social learning, and includes rational choice theories.Social learning theory suggests that people learn from observing and modeling after others\' behavior. With positive reinforcement, the behavior continues. If one observes violent behavior, one is more likely to imitate it. If there are no negative consequences (e. g. victim accepts the violence, with submission), then the behavior will likely continue.Resource theory was suggested by William Goode (1971). Women who are most dependent on the spouse for economic well being (e.g. homemakers/housewives, women with handicaps, the unemployed), and are the primary caregiver to their children, fear the increased financial burden if they leave their marriage. Dependency means that they have fewer options and few resources to help them cope with or change their spouse\'s behavior.Couples that share power equally experience lower incidence of conflict, and when conflict does arise, are less likely to resort to violence. If one spouse desires control and power in the relationship, the spouse may resort to abuse This may include coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, economic abuse, isolation, making light of the situation and blaming the spouse, using children (threatening to take them away), and behaving as master of the castle.Social stress.Stress may be increased when a person is living in a family situation, with increased pressures. Social stresses, due to inadequate finances or other such problems in a family may further increase tensions. Violence is not always caused by stress, but may be one way that some people respond to stress. Families and couples in poverty may be more likely to experience domestic violence, due to increased stress and conflicts about finances and other aspects. Some speculate that poverty may hinder a man\'s ability to live up to his idea of successful manhood, thus he fears losing honor and respect. Theory suggests that when he is unable to economically support his wife, and maintain control, he may turn to misogyny, substance abuse, and crime as ways to express masculinity.Same-sex relationships may experience similar social stressors. Additionally, violence in same-sex relationships has been linked to internalized homophobia, which contributed to low self-esteem and anger in both perpetrator and victim. Internalized homophobia also appears to be a barrier in victims seeking help. Similarly, heterosexism can play a key role in domestic violence in the LGBT community. As a social ideology that implies heterosexuality is normative, morally superior, and better than [homosexuality], heterosexism can hinder services and lead to an unhealthy self-image in sexual minorities. Heterosexism in legal and medical institutions can be seen in instances of discrimination, biases, and insensitivity toward sexual orientation. For example, as of 2006, seven states explicitly denied LGBT individuals the ability to apply for protective orders, proliferating ideas of LGBT subjugation, which is tied to feelings of anger and powerlessness.Power and control.Power and control in abusive relationships is the way that abusers exert physical, sexual and other forms of abuse to gain control within relationships.A causalist view of domestic violence is that it is a strategy to gain or maintain power and control over the victim. This view is in alignment with Bancroft\'s cost-benefit theory that abuse rewards the perpetrator in ways other than, or in addition to, simply exercising power over his or her target(s). He cites evidence in support of his argument that, in most cases, abusers are quite capable of exercising control over themselves, but choose not to do so for various reasons.Sometimes, one person seeks complete power and control over their partner and uses different ways to achieve this, including resorting to physical violence. The perpetrator attempts to control all aspects of the victim\'s life, such as their social, personal, professional and financial decisions.Questions of power and control are integral to the widely utilized Duluth Domestic Abuse Intervention Project. They developed a Power and Control Wheel to illustrate this: it has power and control at the center, surrounded by spokes (techniques used), the titles of which include: coercion and threats, intimidation, emotional abuse, isolation, minimizing, denying and blaming, using children, economic abuse, and privilege.Critics of this model argue that it ignores research linking domestic violence to substance abuse and psychological problems. Some modern research into the patterns in DV has found that women are more likely to be physically abusive towards their partner in relationships in which only one partner is violent, which draws the effectiveness of using concepts like male privilege to treat domestic violence into question. Some modern research into predictors of injury from domestic violence suggests that the strongest predictor of injury by domestic violence is participation in reciprocal domestic violence.On children.3.3 million children witness domestic violence each year in the US. There has been an increase in acknowledgment that a child who is exposed to domestic abuse during their upbringing will suffer developmental and psychological damage. During the mid 1990s, the Adverse Childhood Experiences study (ACE) found that children who were exposed to domestic violence and other forms of abuse had a higher risk of developing mental and physical health problems. Because of the awareness of domestic violence that some children have to face, it also generally impacts how the child develops emotionally, socially, behaviorally as well as cognitively.Some emotional and behavioral problems that can result due to domestic violence include increased aggressiveness, anxiety, and changes in how a child socializes with friends, family, and authorities. Depression, emotional insecurity, and mental health disorders can follow due to traumatic experiences. Problems with attitude and cognition in schools can start developing, along with a lack of skills such as problem-solving. Correlation has been found between the experience of abuse and neglect in childhood and perpetrating domestic violence and sexual abuse in adulthood.Additionally, in some cases the abuser will purposely abuse the mother or father in front of the child to cause a ripple effect, hurting two victims simultaneously. Children may intervene when they witness severe violence against a parent, which can place a child at greater risk for injury or death. It has been found that children who witness mother-assault are more likely to exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Consequences to these children are likely to be more severe if their assaulted mother develops post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and does not seek treatment due to her difficulty in assisting her child with processing his or her own experience of witnessing the domestic violence.Family violence prevention in Australia and other countries has begun to focus on breaking intergenerational cycles; exposing children to family violence is child abuse. Some of the effects of Family Violence on children are highlighted in the Queensland Government and SunnyKids awareness raising campaign.Physical.Bruises, broken bones, head injuries, lacerations, and internal bleeding are some of the acute effects of a domestic violence incident that require medical attention and hospitalization. Some chronic health conditions that have been linked to victims of domestic violence are arthritis, irritable bowel syndrome, chronic pain, pelvic pain, ulcers, and migraines. Victims who are pregnant during a domestic violence relationship experience greater risk of miscarriage, pre-term labor, and injury to or death of the fetus.Psychological.Among victims who are still living with their perpetrators high amounts of stress, fear, and anxiety are commonly reported. Depression is also common, as victims are made to feel guilty for provoking the abuse and are frequently subjected to intense criticism. It is reported that 60% of victims meet the diagnostic criteria for depression, either during or after termination of the relationship, and have a greatly increased risk of suicide. Those who are battered either emotionally or physically often are also depressed because of a feeling of worthlessness. These feelings often persist long-term and it is suggested that many receive therapy for it because of the heightened risk of suicide and other traumatic symptoms.In addition to depression, victims of domestic violence also commonly experience long-term anxiety and panic, and are likely to meet the diagnostic criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder and Panic Disorder. The most commonly referenced psychological effect of domestic violence is Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD (as experienced by victims) is characterized by flashbacks, intrusive images, exaggerated startle response, nightmares, and avoidance of triggers that are associated with the abuse. These symptoms are generally experienced for a long span of time after the victim has left the dangerous situation. Many researchers state that PTSD is possibly the best diagnosis for those suffering from psychological effects of domestic violence, as it accounts for the variety of symptoms commonly experienced by victims of trauma.Financial.Once victims leave their perpetrator, they can be stunned with the reality of the extent to which the abuse has taken away their autonomy. Due to economic abuse and isolation, the victim usually has very little money of their own and few people on whom they can rely when seeking help. This has been shown to be one of the greatest obstacles facing victims of DV, and the strongest factor that can discourage them from leaving their perpetrators.In addition to lacking financial resources, victims of DV often lack specialized skills, education, and training that are necessary to find gainful employment, and also may have several children to support. In 2003, thirty-six major US cities cited DV as one of the primary causes of homelessness in their areas. It has also been reported that one out of every three homeless women are homeless due to having left a DV relationship. If a victim is able to secure rental housing, it is likely that her apartment complex will have zero tolerance policies for crime; these policies can cause them to face eviction even if they are the victim (not the perpetrator) of violence. While the number of shelters and community resources available to DV victims has grown tremendously, these agencies often have few employees and hundreds of victims seeking assistance which causes many victims to remain without the assistance they need.Long-term.Domestic violence can trigger many different responses in victims, all of which are very relevant for any professional working with a victim. Major consequences of domestic violence victimization include psychological/mental health issues and chronic physical health problems. Some long-term effects on a child who comes from an abusive household, or have been abused themselves, are guilt, anger, depression/anxiety, shyness, nightmares, disruptiveness, irritability, and problems getting along with others. Although they may have not been the ones being abused, it still affects them because they had to experience and witness their loved ones being abused, which takes a toll on them as well.Domestic violence also teaches poor family structure. A child who grows up being abused thinks of that as a way a family functions, and has a high risk to grow up and repeat the cycle because that is all they know. Some other long-term effects include, but are not limited to, poor health, low self-esteem, difficulty sleeping, drug and alcohol abuse risk, isolation, suicidal thoughts, and extreme loneliness and fear. A victims overwhelming lack of resources can also lead to homelessness and poverty. A person who has suffered abuse is at risk for a lot of negative consequences that can put them on a destructive path for their future.Daily activities.Women and children experiencing domestic violence undergo occupational apartheid; they are typically denied access to desired occupations. Abusive partners may limit occupations and create an occupationally-void environment which reinforces feelings of low self-worth and poor self-efficacy in ability to satisfactorily perform everyday tasks. Survivors of domestic violence may experience a decline in the skills needed to carry out routine daily activities necessary to live independently in the community. Thispopulation often demonstrates difficulties in the areas of home maintenance, education, caregiving, and leisure participation. In addition, work is impacted by functional losses, ability to maintain necessary employment skills, and ability to function within the work place. Oftentimes the victims are very isolated from other relationships as well such as having few to no friends, this is another method of control for the abuser.On responders.An analysis in the US showed that 106 of the 771 officer killings between 1996 and 2009 occurred during domestic violence interventions. Of these, 51% were defined as unprovoked or as ambushes, taking place before officers had made contact with suspects. Another 40% occurred after contact and the remainder took place during tactical situations (those involving hostages and attempts to overcome barricades). The FBI\'s LEOKA system grouped officer domestic violence response deaths into the category of disturbances, along with bar fights, gang matters, and persons brandishing weapons, which may have given rise to a misperception of the risks involved.Due to the gravity and intensity of hearing victims stories of abuse, professionals (social workers, police, counselors, therapists, advocates, medical professionals) are at risk themselves for secondary or vicarious trauma (VT), which causes the responder to experience trauma symptoms similar to the original victim after hearing about the victims experiences with abuse. Research has demonstrated that professionals who experience vicarious trauma show signs of exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts although they have not experienced a trauma personally and do not qualify for a clinical diagnosis of PTSD.Researchers concluded that although clinicians have professional training and are equipped with the necessary clinical skills to assist victims of domestic violence, they may still be personally affected by the emotional impact of hearing about a victims traumatic experiences. Iliffe et al. found that there are several common initial responses that are found in clinicians who work with victims: loss of confidence in their ability to help the client, taking personal responsibility for ensuring the clients safety, and remaining supportive of the clients autonomy if they make the decision to return to their perpetrator.It has also been shown that clinicians who work with a large number of victims may alter their former perceptions of the world, and begin to doubt the basic goodness of others. Iliffe et al. found that clinicians who work with victims tend to feel less secure in the world, become acutely aware of power and control issues both in society and in their own personal relationships, have difficulty trusting others, and experience an increased awareness of gender-based power differences in society.The best way for a clinician to avoid developing VT is to engage in good self-care practices. These can include exercise, relaxation techniques, debriefing with colleagues, and seeking support from supervisors. Additionally, it is recommended that clinicians make the positive and rewarding aspects of working with domestic violence victims the primary focus of thought and energy, such as being part of the healing process or helping society as a whole. Clinicians should also continually evaluate their empathic responses to victims, in order to avoid feelings of being drawn into the trauma that the victim experienced. It is recommended that clinicians practice good boundaries, and find a balance in expressing empathic responses to the victim while still maintaining personal detachment from their traumatic experiences.Vicarious trauma can lead directly to burnout, which is defined as emotional exhaustion resulting from excessive demands on energy, strength, and personal resources in the work setting. The physical warning signs of burnout include headaches, fatigue, lowered immune function, and irritability. A clinician experiencing burnout may begin to lose interest in the welfare of clients, be unable to empathize or feel compassion for clients, and may even begin to feel aversion toward the client.If the clinician experiencing burnout is working with victims of domestic violence, the clinician risks causing further great harm through re-victimization of the client. However, vicarious trauma does not always directly lead to burnout and burnout can occur in clinicians who work with any difficult population not only those who work with domestic violence victims.Management.Management of domestic violence may take place through medical services, law enforcement, counseling, and other forms of prevention and intervention. Participants in domestic violence may require medical treatment, such as examination by a family physician, other primary care provider, or emergency room physicians.Law enforcement may be called in response to intimate partner violence.Counseling is another means of managing the effects of domestic violence. For the victim of abuse, counseling may include an assessment of the presence, extent and types of abuse. A lethality assessment is a tool that can assist in determining the best course of treatment for a client, as well as helping the client to recognize dangerous behaviors and more subtle abuse in their relationship. In a study of victims of attempted domestic violence-related homicide, only about one-half of the participants recognized that their perpetrator was capable of killing them, as many domestic violence victims minimize the true seriousness of their situation. Another important component is safety planning, which allows the victim to plan for dangerous situations they may encounter, and is effective regardless of their decision on whether remain with their perpetrator.Counseling may be used by offenders to minimize the risk of future domestic violence. Most commonly, to date, convicted or self-referring offenders undertake IPV perpetrators programmes. These are delivered in a group format, one or two hours per week, over a set time period. Programme facilitators guide participants through a curriculum of adult-education style modules, which draw on a variety of therapeutic approaches, but predominantly cognitive behavioural therapy and psycho-education. A debate on the effectiveness of these programmes is on-going. While some (ex-) partners of offenders have experienced improvements in their situation, others have not, and there also appears to be a risk of doing harm.Prevention and intervention includes ways to prevent domestic violence by offering safe shelter, crisis intervention, advocacy, and education and prevention programs. Community screening for domestic violence can be more systematic in cases of animal abuse, healthcare settings, emergency departments, behavioral health settings and court systems. Tools are being developed to facilitate domestic violence screening such as mobile apps. The Duluth Model or Domestic Abuse Intervention Project is a program developed to reduce domestic violence against women, which is the first multi-disciplinary program designed to address the issue of domestic violence by coordinating the actions of a variety of agencies dealing with domestic conflict.Prognosis.New research illustrates that there are strong associations between exposure to domestic violence and abuse in all their forms and higher rates of many chronic conditions. The strongest evidence comes from the Adverse Childhood Experiences study which shows correlations between exposure to abuse or neglect and higher rates in adulthood of chronic conditions, high risk health behaviors and shortened life span. Evidence of the association between physical health and violence against women has been accumulating since the early 1990s.Studies have indicated that it is important to consider the effect of domestic violence and its psychophysiologic sequelae on women who are mothers of infants and young children. Several studies have shown that maternal interpersonal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can, despite traumatized mother\'s best efforts, interfere with their child\'s response to the domestic violence and other traumatic events. Thus, practitioners and service agencies addressing the needs of domestic violence victims should assess the victim-as-parent and evaluate the safety and well-being of children in the home.More recently work by such researchers as Corso have begun to quantify the economic impact of exposure to violence and abuse. A recent publication, Hidden Costs in Health Care: The Economic Impact of Violence and Abuse, makes the case that such exposure represents a serious and costly public health issue that should be addressed by the health care system.Prevention.There exist several strategies that are being used to attempt to prevent or reduce DV. It is important to assess the effectiveness of a strategy that is being implemented.Reforming legislation.Reforming the legislation in order to ensure that DV falls under the scope of the law is important. This may imply repealing existing laws which discriminate against women: according to the WHO, when the law allows husbands to physically discipline wives, implementing a programme to prevent intimate partner violence may have little impact. Marriage laws are also important, They [women] should also be able to enter freely into a marriage or to leave it, to obtain financial credit, and to own and administer property. Abolishing or restricting the offering and receiving of dowry and bride price and scrutinizing the impact of these transactions on the legislative decisions regarding DV is also important. UN Women has stated that the legislation should ensure that a perpetrator of domestic violence, including marital rape, cannot use the fact that he paid bride price as a defence to a domestic violence charge.Changing gender norms.Gender norms that promote the inferiority of women may lead to the abuse of women by intimate partners. The WHO writes that, Dismantling hierarchical constructions of masculinity and femininity predicated on the control of women, and eliminating the structural factors that support inequalities are likely to make a significant contribution to preventing intimate partner and sexual violence.Promoting respectful relations.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, A key strategy in preventing domestic violence is the promotion of respectful, nonviolent relationships through individual, community, and societal level change.Early innervation programs, such as school-based programmes to prevent dating violence are also effective. Children who grow up in violent homes may be led to believe that such behavior is a normal part of life, therefore it is important to challenge such attitudes when they are present among these children.Epidemiology.Domestic violence occurs across the world, in various cultures, and affects people of all economic statuses. According to one study, the percentage of women who have reported being physically abused by an intimate partner vary from 69% to 10% depending on the country.Laws on domestic violence vary by country. While it is generally outlawed in the Western world, this is not the case in many developing countries. For instance, in 2010, the United Arab Emirates\'s Supreme Court ruled that a man has the right to physically discipline his wife and children as long as he does not leave physical marks. The social acceptability of domestic violence also differs by country. While in most developed countries domestic violence is considered unacceptable by most people, in many regions of the world the views are different: according to a UNICEF survey, the percentage of women aged 1549 who think that a husband is justified in hitting or beating his wife under certain circumstances is, for example: 90% in Afghanistan and Jordan, 87% in Mali, 86% in Guinea and Timor-Leste, 81% in Laos, 80% in Central African Republic. Refusing to submit to a husband\'s wishes is a common reason given for justification of violence in developing countries: for instance 62.4% of women in Tajikistan justify wife beating if the wife goes out without telling the husband; 68% if she argues with him; 47.9% if she refuses to have sex with him.Traditionally, in most cultures, men had a legal right to use violence to discipline their wives. Although in the US and many European countries this right was removed from them in the late 19th/early 20th century, before the 1970s criminal arrests were very rare (occurring only in cases of extreme violence), and it was only in the 1990s that rigorous enforcement of laws against domestic violence became standard policy in Western countries.History.Prior to the mid-1800s, most legal systems viewed wife beating as a valid exercise of a husband\'s authority over his wife. One exception, however, was the 1641 Body of Liberties of the Massachusetts Bay colonists, which declared that a married woman should be free from bodilie correction or stripes by her husband.Political agitation during the 19th century led to changes in both popular opinion and legislation regarding domestic violence within the United Kingdom, the United States and other countries. In 1850, Tennessee became the first state in the United States to explicitly outlaw wife beating. Other states soon followed. In 1878, the UK Matrimonial Causes Act made it possible for women in the UK to seek legal separation from an abusive husband. By the end of the 1870s, most courts in the United States had rejected a claimed right of husbands to physically discipline their wives. By the early 20th century, it was common for police to intervene in cases of domestic violence in the United States, but arrests remained rare.Attention to domestic violence began to be drawn in the 1970s by the women\'s movement, particularly within the contexts of feminism and women\'s rights. The first known use of the expression domestic violence in a modern context, meaning spouse abuse, violence in the home was in an address to the Parliament of the United Kingdom in 1973. A few months later the world\'s first domestic violence services federation (Women\'s Aid) was set up to provide practical and emotional support as part of a range of services to women and children experiencing violence in England. Studies in the 1990s showed that men may also be victims of domestic violence.In most legal systems around the world, the issue of DV has been addressed only from the 1990s onwards; indeed, before the late-20th century, in most countries there was very little protection, in law or in practice, against DV. In 1993, the UN published Strategies for Confronting Domestic Violence: A Resource Manual. This publication urged countries around the world to treat DV as a criminal act, stated that the right to a private family life does not include the right to abuse family members, and acknowledged that, at the time of its writing, most legal systems considered DV to be largely outside the scope of the law, describing the situation at that time as follows: Physical discipline of children is allowed and, indeed, encouraged in many legal systems and a large number of countries allow moderate physical chastisement of a wife or, if they do not do so now, have done so within the last 100 years. Again, most legal systems fail to criminalize circumstances where a wife is forced to have sexual relations with her husband against her will. [...] Indeed, in the case of violence against wives, there is a widespread belief that women provoke, can tolerate or even enjoy a certain level of violence from their spouses.In recent decades there has been a call for the end of legal impunity for domestic violence, an impunity often based on the idea that such acts are \'private\'. The Istanbul Convention is the first legally-binding instrument in Europe dealing with domestic violence and violence against women. The convention seeks to put an end to the toleration, in law or in practice, of VAW and DV. In its explanatory report it acknowledges the long tradition of European countries of ignoring, de jure or de facto, these forms of violence. At para 219, it states: There are many examples from past practice in Council of Europe member states that show that exceptions to the prosecution of such cases were made, either in law or in practice, if victim and perpetrator were, for example, married to each other or had been in a relationship. The most prominent example is rape within marriage, which for a long time had not been recognised as rape because of the relationship between victim and perpetrator.There has been increased attention given to specific forms of domestic violence, such as honor killings, dowry deaths, and forced marriages. India has, in recent decades, made efforts to curtail dowry violence: the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act (PWDVA) was enacted in 2005, following years of advocacy and activism by the women\'s organizations. Crimes of passion in Latin America, a region which has a history of treating such killings in an extremely lenient way, have also come to international attention. In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for Human Rights Watch, argued that there are similarities between the dynamics of crimes of passion and honor killings, stating that: crimes of passion have a similar dynamic [to honor killings] in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable.Until quite recently, children had very few rights in regard to protection from violence by their parents, and still continue to do so in many parts of the world. Historically, fathers had virtually unlimited rights in regard to their children and how they chose to discipline them. In many cultures, such as in Ancient Rome, a father could legally kill his children; many cultures have also allowed fathers to sell their children into slavery. Child sacrifice was also a common practice. Today, corporal punishment of children by their parents remains legal in most countries, but in Western countries that still allow the practice there are strict limits on what is permitted. The first country to outlaw parental corporal punishment was Sweden (parents\' right to spank their own children was first removed in 1966, and it was explicitly prohibited by law from July 1979. As of 2015, parental corporal punishment is banned in 46 countries.'),(31902237,'Lady_Eliza_Spencer','Lady Eliza Spencer.The Lady Eliza Victoria Spencer (born 10 July 1992) is the second daughter of Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer and his first wife, Victoria Lockwood.

The song was a commercial success and remains one of Lear\'s biggest hits.Song information.Tomorrow was released as the third single from Amanda\'s debut album I Am a Photograph in 1977. It is an uptempo disco song, written by Rainer Pietsch, with lyrics by Amanda Lear herself. The single was released by Ariola Records in most territories, while Polydor distributed the record in Italy and Nippon Columbia in Japan.The B-side of the 7 single in Italy was The Lady in Black, and a French-language version of Alphabet appeared in France. Queen of Chinatown was released as the B-side in Spain and Portugal (Spanish release had it billed as La reina del barrio chino) while in Japan, the B-side was Pretty Boys.Amanda Lear promoted Tomorrow by numerous TV appearances. The track became one of her biggest hits of the disco era. It reached number 1 spot in Italy in October 1977 and remains the only chart-topper of Lear\'s entire career.In 1998, Lear recorded a new version of the song for the album Back in Your Arms, which consisted of re-recordings of her old hits. That version was performed on television. 2008 saw Lear re-recording Tomorrow again, this time in a salsa-flavoured style, for the album Amour Toujours, which in fact was an updated version of her 2006 With Love album.Music videos.Amanda Lear filmed a number of music videos for Tomorrow. A blue screen video with two backing dancers was produced for Musikladen and can now be found on a 3-DVD box set Das beste aus dem Musikladen Vol. 1, released in 2012.

A council estate is a building complex containing a great many council houses and other amenities like schools and shops. Council houses were solidly built and distinctive in design which evolved over the period of their construction from 1919 to 1980. There were local design variation but they all stuck rigidly to Local Authority building standards- differing from the more relaxed attitude of the private sector.Context.House design in the United Kingdom is defined by a series of Housing Acts, and public housing house design is defined by government directives and central governments relationship with local authorities. From the first interventions in the Public Health Act 1875, council houses could be homes fit for heroes, general housing aimed at the working classes, general housing for all, parts of a slum clearance programme or just homes provided for the most needy. They could be funded directly, through central government incentive or by revenue obtained when other houses were sold. Increasingly, they have been transferred through the instrument of housing associations into the private sector.First World War housing.Woolwich Borough Council was responsible for the Well Hall Estate designed for workers at the munition factories at Woolwich Arsenal. The estate and the house were built to the Garden suburb philosophy, houses were all different. The estate received the Royal seal of approval when on Friday 24 March 1916 when Queen Mary made an unannounced visit.Interwar housing.A programme of council house building started after the First World War following on from the David Lloyd Georges governments Housing Act of 1919. The \'Addison Act\' brought in subsidies for council house building and aimed to provide 500,000 homes fit for heroes within a three year period although less than half of this target was met.The housing built comprised three-bedroom dwellings with parlour and scullery: larger properties also include a living room. The standards are based on the Tudor Walters Report of 1919, and the Design Manual written according to the 1913 building standards.In 1923 the Chamberlain Act withdrew subsidies for council houses except for private builders and houses for sale. Councils could undertake to build houses and offer these for sale but also to sell off some of their existing properties. This was essentially reversed by the incoming Labour government of 1924. The Wheatley Act (1924) passed by the new Labour Government introduced higher subsidies for council housing and also allowed for a contribution to be made from the rates. The housing revenue account was always separated from the general account. This was a major period of council house construction.The Housing Act of 1930 stimulated slum clearance, i.e., the destruction of inadequate houses in the inner cities that were built before the 1875 Act. This released land for housing and the need for smaller two bedroomed houses to replace the two-up two-down houses that had been demolished. Smaller three bedroom properties were also built. The Housing Act of 1935 led to a continuation of this policy and the war stopped all construction and enemy action reduced the usable housing stock.Post-war housing.The immediate post-war period saw the building of prefab bungalows with a design life of ten years. Innovative steel-framed properties were also tried in an attempt to speed up construction. A number survive, a testament to the durability of a series of housing designs and construction methods only envisaged to last 10 years.The Burt Committee formed in 1942, by the wartime government of Winston Churchill proposed to address the need for an anticipated 200,000 shortfall in post-war housing stock, by building 500,000 prefabricated houses, with a planned life of up to 10 years within five years of the end of the Second World War. The eventual bill, agreed under the post-war Labour government of Prime Minister Clement Attlee, agreed to deliver 300,000 units within 10 years, within a budget of 150m. In the end, of 1.2 million new houses built from 1945 to 1951 when the programme officially ended, only 156,623 prefab houses were constructed.Mainly during the immediate post-war years, and well into the 1950s, council house provision was shaped by the New Towns Act 1946 and the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 of the 194551 Labour government. At the same time this government introduced housing legislation that removed explicit references to housing for the working class and introduced the concept of general needs construction (i.e., that council housing should aim to fill the needs for a wide range of society). In particular, Aneurin Bevan, the Minister for Health and Housing, promoted a vision of new estates where the working man, the doctor and the clergyman will live in close proximity to each other.Homes fit for heroes houses (1918-1923).The Addison Act 1919 houses were usually three bedroomed houses with lounge and scullery- or lounge, dining room and scullery. Some had two, four or five bedrooms, and generously sized back gardens intended for vegetable growing. At the best they were built at 12 houses per acre.Seen In Downham, Watling Estate and BecontreeLabour government homes(1924-1930).The Addison Act 1919, and the severe housing shortage in the early 1920s created the first generation of houses to feature electricity, running water, bathrooms, indoor toilets and front/rear gardens. However until well into the 1930s, some were being built with outdoor toilets. Some did not feature an actual bathroom; the bath could often be found in the kitchen with a design which allowed it to double as a work surface.The Wheatley Act 1924, reduced the expected standards. Under the Addison Act a house would be but after 1924 it would be. This was a major period of council house construction.Smaller houses (1931-1939).With the Housing Act of 1930 the government signalled a change of priority,slum clearance. Pre-regulation terraced housing was to be cleared and the residents rehoused in new council houses.There was a cut in funding and the housing density on the peripheral estates was increased leading to a poorer build quality. The former tenants of the inner city properties, were displaced far from their workplaces unable to afford the higher rents (though reduced from the 1919 levels) or the cost of transport. Stable communities were broken up, and with it support networks.Temporary prefabs(1941-1950).All prefab units approved by the Ministry of Works had to have a minimum floor space size of, and the sections should be less than wide.These service units, had to include a combined back-to-back prefabricated kitchen that backed onto a prebuilt bathroom, so water pipes, waste pipes and electrical distribution were all in the same place, and hence easy to install.The house retained a coal-fire, with a back boiler to create both central heating and a constant supply of hot water. Thus it had a bathroom included a flushing toilet and man-sized bath with hot running water. In the kitchen were a built-in oven, refrigerator and baxi water heater. All prefabs under the housing act came pre-decorated in magnolia, with gloss-green on all additional wood, including the door trimmings and skirting boards.Pre-cast reinforced concrete.These were build by prefabrication techniques but had a expect design life of sixty years. They included various kinds such as Airey, Cornish, Wates, Unity, Reema, Tarran, Woolaway and Parkinson types.

Examples of true simulators which aim at piloting a space craft in a manner that conforms with the laws of nature include Orbiter, Kerbal Space Program and Microsoft Space Simulator.Other games involving space flight in 3D space, without restricting movement to a physics system and realistic behaviour, are also commonly called space flight simulators. They aren\'t simulators in the strictest sense of the word.These games do differ from space-based arcade oriented shoot \'em up games that use side-scrolling or top-down perspectives.When the genre appeared in the early 1980s, the use of 3D graphics and 1st person perspective, with the player viewing out of the cockpit, gave a sense of realism. This the designation of space flight simulators, even though a better name for these games would be pseudo simulators or space flight games. Most space combat simulators and space trading simulators can be placed in the pseudo space flight simulator category.Space flight games and simulators, at one time popular, had for most of the new millennium been considered a dead genre. However, open-source and enthusiast communities managed to produce some working, modern titles (see the free Orbiter Spaceflight Simulator), and 2011\'s commercially released Kerbal Space Program was notably well-received, even by the aerospace community.Some games in the genre have the aim of recreating a realistic portrayal of space flight, involving the calculation of orbits within a more complete physics simulation than pseudo space flight simulators. Others focus on gameplay rather than simulating space flight in all its facets. The realism of the latter games is limited to what the game designer deems to be appropriate for the gameplay, instead of focusing on the realism of moving the spacecraft in space. Some flight models use a physics system based on Newtonian physics, but these are usually limited to manoeuvring the craft in its direct environment, and do not take into consideration the orbital calculations that would make such a game a simulator. Most of the pseudo simulators feature faster than light travel.Realistic simulation.Realistic space simulators seek to represent a vessel\'s behaviour under the influence of the Laws of Physics.As such, the player normally concentrates on following checklists or planning tasks. Piloting is generally limited to dockings, landings or orbital maneuvers. The reward for the player is on mastering real or realistic spacecraft, celestial mechanics and astronautics.Classical games with this approach include \' (1982), \' (1982), The Halley Project (1985), Shuttle (1992) and Microsoft Space Simulator (1994).If the definition is expanded to include decision making and planning, then Buzz Aldrin\'s Race Into Space (1992) is also notable for historical accuracy and detail. On this game the player takes the role of Administrator of NASA or Head of the Soviet Space Program with the ultimate goal of being the first side to conduct a successful manned moon landing.Most recently Orbiter and Space Shuttle Mission 2007 provide more elaborate simulations, with realistic 3D virtual cockpits and external views.Kerbal Space Program can be considered a space simulator, even though it portrays an imaginary universe with tweaked physics, masses and distances to enhance gameplay. Nevertheless, the physics and rocket design principles are much more realistic than in the space combat or trading subgenres.The game Lunar Flight simulates flying around the lunar surface in a craft resembling the Apollo Lunar Module.Space combat game.Most games in the space combat genre feature futuristic scenarios involving space flight and extra planetary combat. Such games generally place the player into the controls of a small starfighter or smaller starship in a military force of similar and larger spaceships and don\'t take into account the physics of space flight, usually often citing some technological advancement to explain the lack thereof. The prominent Wing Commander, \', X-Wing and Freespace series all use this approach. Exceptions include the first Independence War and the \' series, which model craft at a larger scale and/or in a more strategic fashion. It should be noted that I-War also features Newtonian style physics for the behaviour of the space craft, but not orbital mechanics.Space combat games tend to be mission-based, as opposed to the more open-ended nature of space trading and combat games.Space trading and combat game.The general formula for the space trading and combat game, which has changed little since its genesis, is for the player to begin in a relatively small, outdated ship with little money or status and for the player to work his or her way up, gaining in status and power through trading, exploration, combat or a mix of different methods. The ship the player controls is generally larger than that in pure space combat simulator. Notable examples of the genre include Elite, \', and Freelancer.In some instances, plot plays only a limited role and only a loose narrative framework tends to be provided. In certain titles of the X series, for instance, players may ignore the plot for as long as they wish and are even given the option to disable the plot completely and instead play in sandbox mode. Many games of this genre place a strong emphasis on factional conflict, leading to many small mission-driven subplots that unravel the tensions of the galaxy.Games of this type often allow the player to choose among multiple roles to play and multiple paths to victory. This aspect of the genre is very popular, but some people have complained that, in some titles, the leeway given to the player too often is only superficial, and that, in reality, the roles offered to players are very similar, and open-ended play too frequently restricted by scripted sequences. As an example, Freelancer has been criticised for being too rigid in its narrative structure, being in one case compared negatively with Grand Theft Auto, another series praised for its open-ended play.All space trading and combat games feature the core gameplay elements of directly controlling the flight of some sort of space vessel, generally armed, and of navigating from one area to another for a variety of reasons. As technology has improved it has been possible to implement a number of extensions to gameplay, such as dynamic economies, cooperative online play, Overall, the core gameplay mechanics of the genre have changed little over the years.Some recent games, such as 2003\'s EVE Online, have expanded the scope of the experience by including thousands of simultaneous online players in what is sometimes referred to as a living universea dream some have held since the genre\'s early beginnings. Star Citizen, a 2016 (est.) title in open, crowd-funded development by Chris Roberts and others involved in Freelancer and Wing Commander, aims to bridge the gap between the EVE-like living universe game and the fast action of other games in the genre.Kerbal Space Program, which has a realistic physics simulation, has some characteristics of a space trading game in some way. For example, it includes a career mode, in which spaceship parts are unlocked through Science and has funds, contracts and a reputation system.An additional sub-class of space trading games eliminate combat entirely, focusing instead entirely on trading and economic manipulation in order to achieve success.Space flight games.Most modern space flight games on the personal computer allow a player to utilise a combination of the WASD keys of the keyboard and mouse as a means of controlling the game (games such as Microsoft\'s Freelancer use this control system exclusively). By far the most popular control system among genre enthusiasts, however, is the joystick. Most fans prefer to use this input method whenever possible, but expense and practicality mean that many are forced to use the keyboard and mouse combination (or gamepad if such is the case). The lack of uptake among the majority of modern gamers has also made joysticks a sort of an anachronism, though some new controller designs and simplification of controls offer the promise that space sims may be playable in their full capacity on gaming consoles at some time in the future. In fact, \', sometimes considered one of the more cumbersome and difficult series of to master within the trading and combat genre, was initially planned for the Xbox but later cancelled.Realistic simulators.Realistic simulators feature spacecraft systems and instrument simulation, using a combination of extensive keyboard shortcuts and mouse clicks on virtual instrument panels. Most of the maneuvers and operations consist of setting certain systems into the desired configuration, or in setting autopilots.Real time hands on piloting can happen, depending on the simulated spacecraft. For example, it\'s common to use a joystick analog control to land a space shuttle (or any other spaceplane) or the LEM (or similar landers). Dockings can be performed more precisely using the numerical keypad.Overall, the simulations have more complex control systems than game, with the limit being the physical reproduction of the actual simulated spacecraft (see SimPit).History.Early attempts at 3D space simulation date back as far as 1974\'s Spasim, an online multi-player space simulator in which players attempt to destroy each other\'s ships.The earliest known space trader dates to 1974\'s Star Trader, a game where the entire interface was text-only and included a star map with multiple ports buying and selling 6 commodities. It was written in BASIC.The modern space flight game genre emerged at the point when home computers became sufficiently powerful to draw basic wireframe graphics in real-time. The game Elite is widely considered to be the breakthrough game of the genre, and as having successfully melded the space trading and flight sim genres. Elite was highly influential upon later games of its type, although it did have some precursors, and games similar to Elite are sometimes called Elite-clones.Elite.Elite has made a lasting impression on developers, worldwide, extending even into different genres. In interviews, senior producers of CCP Games cited Elite as one of the inspirations for their acclaimed MMORPG, EVE Online. Thorolfur Beck credits Elite as the game that impacted him most on the Commodore 64. Developers of Jumpgate Evolution, Battlecruiser 3000AD, \', \' and Flatspace likewise all claim Elite as a source of inspiration.Elite was named one of the sixteen most influential games in history at Telespiele, a German technology and games trade show, and is being exhibited at such places as the London Science Museum in the Game On exhibition organized and toured by the Barbican Art Gallery. Elite was also named #12 on IGN\'s 2000 Top 25 PC Games of All Time list, the #3 most influential video game ever by the Times Online in 2007, and best game ever for the BBC Micro by Beebug Magazine in 1984. Elites sequel, \', was named #77 on PC Zone\'s 101 Best PC Games Ever list in 2007. Similar praise has been bestowed elsewhere in the media from time to time.Elite is one of the most popularly requested games to be remade, and some argue that it is still the best example of the genre to date, with more recent titlesincluding its sequelnot rising up to its level. It has been credited as opening the door for future online persistent worlds, such as Second Life and World of Warcraft, and as being the first truly open-ended game. It is to this day one of the most ambitious games ever made, residing in only 22 kilobytes of memory and on a single floppy disk. The latest incarnation of the franchise, titled \' was released on the 16 of December 2014, following a successful Kickstarter campaign.Trade Wars.Though not as well known as Elite, Trade Wars is noteworthy as the first multiplayer space trader. A BBS door, Trade Wars was released in 1984 as an entirely different branch of the space trader tree, having been inspired by Hunt the Wumpus, the board game Risk, and the original space trader, Star Trader. As a pure space trader, Trade Wars lacked any space flight simulator elements, instead featuring abstract Open World trading and combat set in an outer space populated by both real and NPC opponents. It was influential in its own right, with developers of modern space traders like Star Citizen, Jumpgate, and Earth and Beyond citing it as an inspiration, and other games like EVE Online and Pardus frequently compared to it. In 2009, it was named the #10 best PC game by PC World Magazine.Trade Wars has shown an extraordinary reach and longevity. As of 2013, nearly 30 years after its original release, multiplayer Trade Wars games have been hosted on over 20,000 sites in 59 different countries, with hundreds of game sites hosting thousands of players in 2012.Other examples.Elite was not the first game to take flight game mechanics into outer space. Other notable earlier examples include Star Raiders (1979), Space Shuttle: A Journey into Space (1982), Rendezvous: A Space Shuttle Simulation (1982), and \' (1982), which featured five different controls to learn, six different enemies, and 40 different simulation levels of play, making it one of the most elaborate vector games ever released. Other early examples include Nasir Gebelli\'s 1982 Apple II computer games Horizon V which featured an early radar mechanic and Zenith which allowed the player ship to rotate, and Ginga Hyoryu Vifam, which allowed first-person open space exploration with a radar displaying the destination and player/enemy positions as well as an early physics engine where approaching a planet\'s gravitational field pulls the player towards it. Following Elite were games such as The Halley Project (1985), Echelon (1987) and Microsoft Space Simulator (1994).Star Luster, released for the NES console and arcades in 1985, featured a cockpit view, a radar displaying enemy and base locations, the ability to warp anywhere, and a date system keeping track of the current date.Some tabletop and board games, such as Traveller or Merchant of Venus, also feature themes of space combat and trade. Traveller influenced the development of Elite (the main character in Traveller is named Jamison; the main character in Elite is named Jameson) and Jumpgate Evolution.Decline.The seeming decline of the space flight simulators and games in the late 1990s coincided with the rise of the RTS, FPS and RPG game genres, with such examples as Warcraft, Doom and Diablo. The very things that made these games classics, such as their open-endedness, complex controls and attention to detail, have been cited as reasons for this decline.Resurgence.Some recent franchises such as the X series and EVE Online, may end a decade in which no new title of the genre was published. The open source community has also been active, with recent projects such as FS2 Open and Vega Strike serving as platforms for nonprofessional efforts. Unofficial remakes of Elite and Privateer are even being made using the Vega Strike engine, and the latter has reached the stage where it is offered as a working title to the public.In November 2012 Star Citizen set a new record for crowdfunding. It has managed to raise more than $83 million as of April 2015. \' was also successfully crowdfunded on Kickstarter in November and December 2012. Born Ready Games also closed a successful Kickstarter campaign at the end of 2012 raising almost $180,000 to assist with the completion of Strike Suit Zero which was released January 2013. Another open ended space sim in development is No Man\'s Sky.On March 10, 2013, the space flight simulator Kerbal Space Program reached the top 5 best selling games after its release on Steam.'),(44683836,'Woolloongabba_Post_Office','Woolloongabba Post Office.Woolloongaba Post Office is a heritage-listed former post office at 765 Stanley Street, Woolloongabba, City of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia. It was designed by Thomas Pye and built in 1905 by Thomas Rees. It is also known as Woolloongabba Post & Telegraph Office. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 January 2003.History.The Woolloongabba Post & Telegraph Office was constructed in 1905 for the Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs, to a plan designed and supervised by the Queensland Government Architect in the Queensland Department of Public Works.It replaced an earlier Woolloongabba Post & Telegraph Office, opened in rented premises in Logan Road, in 1887. The population of Woolloongabba, which had grown steadily between the 1860s and 1880s, increased rapidly following the expansion of the railway line to Woolloongabba in 1884, and the extension of the electric tramway to Woolloongabba/East Brisbane in 1897. During the 1880s and 1890s the \'Gabba developed as Brisbane\'s fourth major shopping centre, the others being Brisbane CBD, Fortitude Valley and Stanley Street at South Brisbane. By the turn of the century, most of the allotments facing Stanley Street, Logan Road and Ipswich Road at the Woolloongabba Fiveways were fully developed commercial sites.Following the separation of Queensland from New South Wales in 1859 and prior to Federation of Australia in 1901, the Queensland Government organised the postal service for the state. In 1901 the newly established Commonwealth Government became responsible for communications, and the Commonwealth Postmaster-General\'s Department was created. The transfer of responsibilities from the States to the Commonwealth was gradual, and the Queensland Department of Works continued to carry out design and documentation of post offices on behalf of the Commonwealth Government until.Alfred Barton Brady was employed with the Queensland Government as Government Architect from 1892-1922. Brady claimed that he always advised on arrangement, style and materials, but it appears that his Senior Assistant, Thomas Pye supervised much of the detailed design. During the 30 years they worked together in the Department, Brady and Pye assembled a talented group of architects and draftsmen who were considered the equal of any in Australia, including from 1893 to 1903 John Smith Murdoch, who was to become Commonwealth Director-General of Works in 1927. Pye later served as deputy government architect from 1906 to 1921, and a major example of his work is the former Executive Building (now known as the Land Administration Building) in William Street. From the office of the Government Architect there developed a tradition of fine government buildings, including many post offices, customs houses and court houses throughout the State.A new post office building was proposed as early as 1901, and approval was given in August 1902 to purchase the present site for 1,250. The site was previously owned by the Wesleyan Methodist Church, and provided the Commonwealth with the opportunity to acquire a site for the post office that was on one of the three major streets which formed the Fiveways and was within close proximity of the centre of local activity, the Wooloongabba Branch railway line and the tramway.In October 1903 the Commonwealth requested the Queensland Department of Public Works to prepare sketch plans for the building and to survey the site.Working plans for the building were completed in 1904, under Pye\'s supervision.The design accommodated a large mail room on the ground floor and residential accommodation for the postmaster on the first. This comprised dining and sitting rooms, four bedrooms, kitchen, bathroom, scullery, store, rear verandah and front piazza. The latter was a concession to the climate which was unusual in commercial buildings of the time. Provision was made for a ground floor extension along the northwestern side.Tenders were called in February-March 1905, and the contract was let to builder Thomas Rees with a price of 2,174.Completed in November 1905, the Woolloongabba Post & Telegraph Office was one of only five masonry post offices constructed in Queensland between 1900 and 1910. In addition to Woolloongabba, these included post offices at Ipswich (1900), Stanthorpe (1901), Cairns (1906, no longer extant) and Mount Morgan (1910).The ground floor of the building has undergone several alterations, as the spaces were re-organised to suit the changing functions of the post office. The first floor ceased to function as a residence during the 1950s, and was converted for use by the staff and the district inspector. During the 1960s the first floor was further altered to include a mail room, and most of the remaining partitions were removed. The building was refurbished in 1988, and from 1989 the first floor was leased to the Genealogical Society of Queensland.The building closed as a post office in 1994, although some offices remain in use by Australia Post.Description.The former Woolloongabba Post Office is a two-storeyed rendered masonry building with cement dressings and hipped corrugated iron roofs, located on the corner of Stanley and Hubert Streets. It is richly decorated, and makes a prominent contribution through form, scale and detail to the predominantly parapeted commercial streetscape of Stanley St.Originally constructed to accommodate a post and telegraph office on the ground floor, and a residence on the first floor, the form and detail of the exterior of the building is skilfully designed to articulate the domestic and public roles of the building. The post office is composed as a single major volume under a hipped roof with ventilated gables, with an attached tower over the entrance vestibule at the corner of Hubert and Stanley Sts. On the north elevation, facing Stanley St, the residence sits behind a piazza or loggia. Towards the rear facing Hubert St, the building, assumes a more domestic character, with a prominent and richly detailed awning, a separate, smaller hipped roof, and a chimney which rises above the roof line. The southern (rear) frontage has a deep timber verandah, and the western frontage overlooking the service lane is unrendered and undecorated. The building has deep eaves with shaped rafter ends.The two street-facing elevations have horizontal tripartite ornamentation, comprising: a square-snecked rubble stone plinth; cement string course to ground floor sill level; course aggregate rendered walls to the piano nobile; and unrendered brickwork expressed as pilasters above a first floor string course. These elevations are linked with cement banding. The corner tower has large openings at the base with deep lintels with dentils and scrolls. The single windows above have pilasters and single scrolled brackets under the sill, and are surmounted by deep arched hood mouldings with cartouches. The tower roof is topped with an idiosyncratic concave peak and finial. The Stanley St frontage has paired windows to the ground floor either side of a set of three windows surmounted by the central feature of the elevation; an arch with dentils over small cartouches around a large, elaborate cartouche bearing the words POST & TELEGRAPH OFFICE. The more recently added metal WOOLLOONGABBA POST OFFICE, also appears on the Stanley St elevation. The loggia above has brick spandrels and columns with rounded cement capitals.The openings to the Hubert St elevations have dentils to the ground floor, and single scrolled brackets and sills to the first floor. The main entrance to the former residence on Hubert St comprises a timber lined barrel vault supported on delicate metal brackets, over a central door with a coloured glass arched fanlight flanked by single windows. A second entrance is provided around the corner on the south elevation, which also has an arched coloured glass fanlight and an arched brick lintel.The verandah to the south, now partially enclosed, has a timber balustrade with timber posts, and timber battens to the verandah soffit. The brickwork to the south is unrendered, revealing splayed brick lintels.Internally, the former residence is accessed via a set of timber stairs in the south eastern corner of the building. The stairs have turned balusters and substantial newel posts with chamfered rectangular tops. On the first floor, the former residence partition walls have been removed, however the remaining large space retains its timber lined ceilings, a single fretwork ceiling ventilator panel, a former kitchen fireplace, and a fireplace in the south eastern corner with fine timber panelling and ceramic tiled surrounds. Some of the decorative ironmongery remains, including wall ventilator panels, escutcheon plates, and a teardrop-shaped door handle at the ground floor entrance.The ground floor has also undergone substantial alterations with the installation of new partitions for offices and new ceilings, but retains a central cast iron column and panelled beams traversing the former large mail room. The column has an identification plate at its base which reads HARVEY Margaret St Brisbane.Heritage listing.Woolloongaba Post Office (former) was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 24 January 2003 having satisfied the following criteria.The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland\'s history.The former Woolloongabba Post Office survives as evidence of the rapid growth of Woolloongabba which accompanied the expansion of public transport in Brisbane around the turn of the century. Both the population boom and the substantial masonry post office building at Woolloongabba are illustrative of the late 1890s/early 1900s economic high on which Queensland entered the 20th century.The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland\'s cultural heritage.The former Woolloongabba Post Office is one of few extant substantial masonry post office buildings erected in Queensland during the early 20th century.The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places.The form and detail of the exterior of the building is skilfully designed to articulate the domestic and public roles of the building. The former post office illustrates competency in design and workmanship, and reflects the high standard of Government buildings in Queensland, designed by the Department of Public Works during the early 20th century. When erected, the building was unusual for its incorporation of a piazza in a commercial building.The place is important because of its aesthetic significance.The former post office, located within the predominantly commercial Stanley Street streetscape, displays fine quality public architecture with a strong civic presence.The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland\'s history.The former post office illustrates competency in design and workmanship, and reflects the high standard of Government buildings in Queensland, designed by the Department of Public Works during the early 20th century.Attribution.This Wikipedia article was originally based on published by the State of Queensland under license (accessed on 7 July 2014, on 8 October 2014).

She was portrayed by Jenny Platt making her first onscreen appearance on 8 October 2004 and remained until 29 February 2008. Platt returned for one episode on 24 April 2011.Storylines.Violet arrives on the Street on in October 2004, as a barmaid in the Rovers Return Inn. A former pupil of Ken Barlow (William Roache) when he was a teacher at Weatherfield Comprehensive, she addresses him as Sir during her time on the Street. Violet befriends neighbour Katy Harris (Lucy-Jo Hudson) and is good friends with Sean Tully (Antony Cotton), whom she knew before moving to Coronation Street. Violet begins a relationship with Jason Grimshaw (Ryan Thomas), whose mother Eileen (Sue Cleaver) finds Violet a pleasant young woman. After some unease by Violet, who states that she had left home at a young age to live with an older, dominant man, she moves into 11 Coronation Street with Jason. They break up after Violet is seduced by Charlie Stubbs, but reunite. The relationship breaks up when Jason has an affair with Sarah-Louise Platt (Tina O\'Brien). Jason proposes to Violet but she turns him down.Violet soon begins dating Jamie Baldwin (Rupert Hill). She moves in with him but after a while she starts to doubt Jamie\'s loyalties in September 2006, when he begins spending more time with Sean, than her and worries that Jamie is interested in Sean, who is gay. Violet asks Sean to find out if Jamie is gay but Sean discovers that Jamie is having an affair with his stepmother Frankie (Debra Stephenson). Violet discovers she is pregnant in December with Jamie\'s baby and tells him but is shocked and disgusted when he confesses the truth about his affair with Frankie and is further upset when she discovers Sean\'s knowledge of the affair. Violet suffers an ectopic pregnancy on New Years Day 2007, and has to have emergency surgery to remove her Fallopian tube and the baby.She is then told that she has a reduced chance of conceiving.While drunk, Violet and Sean make a pact - if they are both single and childless by 30, they would have a child together. Violet ponders over this, and agrees to try for a child together immediately, due to Violet\'s reduced fertility. In July 2007, Violet finds out she is expecting Sean\'s baby. When Violet tells Sean, he is thrilled that she is going to be a mother. Violet makes him keep it secret for the first 12 weeks but Sean is so excited aboutViolet\'s pregnancy, he tells Jamie. Violet is angry and upset when she finds out. Sean tricks his boyfriend - sonographer Marcus Dent (Charlie Condou) - into telling him that Violet is expecting a baby boy. He wants to know the sex of the baby but Violet doesn\'t. He tells Jason and Jamie about Violet expecting a boy and Jason accidentally lets slip to Violet. She is furious with Sean for betraying her and making her feel worthless. Sean soon discovers that Violet is planning to bring up their baby without him, and when he confronts her about being pushed out, she tells him that she sees him as the donor, not the father. Upset, he warns Violet that he will take legal action, and she walks out in a rage. Violet and Sean later apologize to one another and the friendship is rekindled.Violet reunites with Jamie shortly after attending his mother Carol\'s wedding in Birmingham as his date. After restarting the relationship, they move in together and both agree to bring up the baby together. Violet goes into labour on 22 February 2008 while in Rovers with Sean by her side and names her newborn son Dylan.She is unhappy about the situation as Jamie is away, moving some of their belongings down to London. Sean quickly bonds with Dylan and is ecstatic to be a dad but Violet, however, is sad that Sean has bonded with the baby since she can\'t take Dylan away from him. The following week Violet proposes and Jamie accepts straight away and they prepare to leave Manchester butViolet\'s sister Lauren (Lucy Evans) alerts Sean after she sees Jamie loading up the car. Sean tries to stop Violet but she and Jamie speed away. Sean phone Violet but she throws her mobile out of the car, making sure Sean cannot contact them.Two years later, Sean decides that he wants to make contact with his Dylan and set out to do so by making contact with Violet via social networking site Facescene, similar to Facebook. Knowing that Violet does not want any contact with him, he sets up a page under Liz McDonald\'s (Beverley Callard) name and asks her to e-mail some pictures of Dylan, who is now two. Violet does so and confesses to \'Liz\' that she feels bad for alienating Sean, to which \'Liz\' berates Violet for doing so. Upset, Violet rings The Rovers, demanding answers from Liz. Liz discovers Sean\'s deception and fires him, but rehires him when she realizes how upset and desperate he was to see his son and then phones Violet back, asking her to let Sean see Dylan to which she accepts. Sean heads down to London in April 2011 to visit Dylan and discovers Violet and Jamie arguing and he and Marcus who have recently reconciled, take Dylan out for the day and when they return they witness Jamie leaving in a Taxi. They try to comfort Violet but she is homophobic towards Sean and they leave. Violet is later injured in a crash and is hospitalized with back problems and her grandmother rings Sean and asks him to look after Dylan. Sean is worried at first but is able to connect with him. After several months, Violet calls Sean, telling him she is ready to have Dylan back and he is reluctant, however she agrees he and Marcus can visit him anytime they want.Background.Violet first appeared on 8 October 2004 and the character was originally going to be called Julie, Platt stated filming in August 2004.In 2007, Sunday Newspaper The People reported that Platt had quit the serial. However, the Serial\'s producers denied the reports and a spokesperson confirmed on Digital Spy that she had signed a new one-year contract taking her through to March 2008.Platt returned to the serial for one episode in 2011.Pregnancy.In one storyline, Violet falls pregnant to Jamie Baldwin. Platt commented on the way she handled the delicate storyline offscreen stating: Obviously, I wanted to find out about it. Violet actually doesn\'t know anything about it - she just wakes up in the hospital and is told about it, so I kind of didn\'t need it. It wasn\'t like I got diagnosed and had to live with it for a while. By the time I\'ve woken up everything\'s gone. But, just for my own interest, I did, I looked into it and found out a bit about it. I looked at the NHS site to find out what the symptoms would be, and how common it is, all that kind of stuff.Lesbian Storyline.After the character had left the show it was later revealed that the soap\'s bosses had been on the look out for a lesbian character since 2004, the year that the character entered the series. The original intentions were revealed for the character, that were to make her the soaps first lesbian character in the shows history. Due to the popularity of her two relationships within the characters early storylines the idea was scrapped at the last minute. An ITV insider told the News of the World on July 2008: Executives want to create a soap which is representative of society in 2008 and they are acutely aware they need more gay characters. They went on: It does seem ridiculous it (lesbianism) has never been explored on Corrie but that\'s all about to change. Later it was revealed that producers had shifted the plans they had once put onto Platt\'s character onto fellow character Sophie Webster.'),(2266706,'Job_security','Job security.Job security is the probability that an individual will keep his or her job; a job with a high level of job security is such that a person with the job would have a small chance of becoming unemployed.Basic economic theory holds that during periods of economic expansion businesses experience increased demand, which in turn necessitates investment in more capital or labor. When businesses are experiencing growth, job confidence and security typically increase. The opposite often holds true during a recession: businesses experience reduced demand and look to downsize their workforces in the short term.Governments and individuals are both motivated to achieve higher levels of job security. Governments attempt to do this by passing laws (such as the U.S. Civil Rights Act of 1964) which make it illegal to fire employees for certain reasons. Individuals can influence their degree of job security by increasing their skills through education and experience, or by moving to a more favorable location. The official unemployment rate and employee confidence indexes are good indicators of job security in particular fields. These statistics are closely watched by economists, government officials, and banks.Unions also strongly influence job security. Jobs that traditionally have a strong union presence such as many government jobs and jobs in education, healthcare and law enforcement are considered very secure while many non-unionized private sector jobs are generally believed to offer lower job security, although this varies by industry and country.Measuring job security.This is a list of countries by job security, an important component in measuring quality of life and the well-being of its citizens. It lists OECD countries\' workers\' chance of losing their job in 2012, with some non-OECD countries also included. Workers facing a high risk of job loss are more vulnerable, especially in countries with smaller social safety nets. This indicator presents the probability to become unemployed, calculated as the number of people who were unemployed in 2012, but were employed in 2011 over the total number of employed in 2011.In the United States.While all economies are impacted by market forces (which change the supply and demand of labor) the United States is particularly susceptible to these forces due to a long history of fiscal conservatism and minimal government intervention.Minimal government intervention has helped the United States create an at-will employment system that applies across many industries. Consequently, with limited exceptions, an employees job security closely follows an employer\'s demand for their skills. For example, in the aftermath of the dot com boom of 1997-2000, employees in the technology industry experienced a massive drop in job security and confidence. More recently, in 2009 many manufacturing workers experienced a similar drop in job security and confidence. Closely following market forces also means that employment in the United States rebounds when industries adjust to new economic realities. For example, employee confidence and job security in both manufacturing and technology have rebounded substantially.In the United States job insecurity is higher for men than women, with workers aged 3064 experiencing more insecurity when compared with other age groups. Divorced or separated workers, and workers with less than a high school diploma also report higher job insecurity. Overall, workers in the construction industry have the highest rate of job insecurity at 55%.The impact of unemployment and job insecurity on both mental and physical health is now the subject of a growing body of research. This will offer insights into why, for example, an increasing number of men in the United States are not returning to work. In 1960, only 5% of men ages 30-35 were unemployed whereas roughly 13% were unemployed in 2006. The New York Times attributes a large portion of this to blue collar and professional men refusing to work in jobs that they are overqualified for or do not provide adequate benefits in contrast to their previous jobs. It could also be attributed to a mismatch between the skills employees currently have, and the skills employers in traditionally male dominated industries (such as manufacturing) are looking for.According to data from 2014 employee confidence reports, 50% of all current workers 18 and over feel confident in their ability to find a new job if necessary, and 61% are confident in the future of their employer. Job insecurity, defined as being worried about becoming unemployed, is a concern to 25% of U.S. workers.Outsourcing.Overseas outsourcing (sometimes called offshoring) may decrease job security for people in certain occupations such as telemarketers, computer programmers, and bookkeeping clerks. Generally, to outsource work to a different country the job must be quick to learn and the completed work must be transferrable with minimal loss of quality.In Europe.The main difference vis--vis the United States is the system of indefinite contracts. In most European countries many employees have indefinite contracts which, whilst not guaranteeing a job for life, make it very difficult for the employer to terminate a contract. Employees who have legally acquired these rights, for example because they have been with a company for two years continuously, can only be dismissed for disciplinary reasons (after a number of formal warnings and subject to independent appeal) or in the case of a company undergoing restructuring (subject to generous laws on redundancy payments and often with retraining paid for by the company). In Spain, for example, such employees are entitled to 45 days redundancy pay per year worked. The high cost of redundancy payments is in practice what gives employees job security.Whilst employees who have such legally binding, indefinite contracts are in the enviable position of knowing that they (and their family) have complete financial security for the rest of their lives, it is important to realise that these obligations work both ways. In some countries such as Germany a company may prevent an employee (whose occupational training they have paid for) from leaving to take up a better post elsewhere until compensation is agreed. Even an employee of a company which is known to be about to fold may find themselves compelled to stay with the company until the end even if they are offered work with a different firm.Every company will have a mix of employees on different types of contract. Indefinite contracts can also exist for seasonal work. These so-called discontinuous contracts mean that a hotel, for example, may dismiss its staff in the autumn, but it must take the same people back on again the following spring.The proportion of the workforce on indefinite contracts has fallen across Europe in response to increased competition and globalization. Companies may dismiss an employee just before they reach the two-year mark and then re-hire them as a new employee. Many economists argue that greater labour market flexibility is necessary. Economics professors argue that the threat of unemployment is necessary to maintain incentives to high productivity. Meanwhile, John Kenneth Galbraith has argued in The Affluent Society that some established economics professors simultaneously seek tenure. Jobs that are not backed by an indefinite contract are still poorly regarded in many European societies, often disparagingly described as precarious or McJobseven when the company has good prospects.In less regulated European economies, such as the United Kingdom, it is much cheaper to sack permanent employees. In Britain, employees are only entitled to a legal minimum of one week\'s redundancy pay per year worked (one and a half weeks for workers over 40 years old). Instead, private- and public-sector employees who feel they have been unfairly dismissed have the right to take the company to an Employment Tribunal in order to be re-instated or to obtain extra compensation. It is not necessary to go through the normal court system.In Sweden, employment contracts can be time-limited, and can be extended for new time-limited periods, or not, without reason. This is only allowed for the first two years of employment. At expiration the employee will stand without job and without compensation if no extension takes place. Most unemployed people, if they get a job, get a time-limited contract in Sweden.In all European Union countries an employee retains their existing contractual rights if their company is taken over under the Acquired Rights Directive (in the UK, known as TUPE) so the years spent working for the old company would count when calculating redundancy payments, etc.Job security score.A job security score is a numerical expression of an individual\'s unemployment risk based on a statistical analysis of a person\'s individual demographics, such as location, industry, and occupation, as well as external factors, such as technology, outsourcing, and overseas competition, which is captured in macroeconomic data and trends. Job Security Score also represents the creditworthiness of an individual based on their ability-to-pay by predicting an individual\'s probability of unemployment risk. It is similar to the Credit Score, which represents the creditworthiness of an individual based on their willingness-to-pay by evaluating an individual\'s probability of paying debts in a timely manner. The Job Security Score is a patent-pending payment risk scoring technology that was first developed by Scorelogix, a pioneer in consumer risk analytics.Job Security Index.Job security index is a measure of job conditions. Developed by Scorelogix, Job Security Index is represents how economic factors, internet and computers, international trade and competition, outsourcing, offshoring, job migration, etc., are impacting the demand and supply of employment. A higher Job Security Index for a region, such as a ZIP code, county or metropolitan statistical area (MSA), indicates that people in that region have a better opportunity of finding jobs and remaining employed. A lower Job Security Index for a ZIP or county means that job are relatively difficult to find and keep. Typically, cities and counties that have a larger concentration of government jobs or education related jobs have a higher Job Security Index values as these jobs are less impacted by the economy.Other meanings.Computer programmers half in jest consider complicated or badly documented software as added job security because it would be difficult to replace them with programmers unfamiliar with the software.'),(5573207,'Oscar_Loew','Oscar Loew.Oscar Loew (2 April 1844  26 January 1941) was a German agricultural chemist, active in Germany, the United States, and Japan in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.Biography.Loew was born in Marktredwitz, Bavaria, where his father was a pharmacist. He studied at the University of Munich under the noted chemist Justus von Liebig; he was Liebig\'s last student. Loew was an assistant in plant physiology at the City College of New York and participated in four expeditions to the southwestern United States in 1882 before returning to Munich, Germany, where he collaborated with Karl Wilhelm von Ngeli. Loew became associate professor at Munich University in 1886. In 1893, he was recruited by the Meiji government of Japan as a foreign advisor, and travelled to Tokyo, where he remained until 1898. Loew served as instructor at Tokyo Imperial University between 18931907, succeeding Oskar Kellner as professor of agricultural chemistry there. He trained many notable Japanese chemists, including Umetaro Suzuki. While in Japan, he researched the effects of lime on acidic soils.On the expiration of his contract in 1898, Loew moved to Washington, D.C., where he worked in the United States Department of Agriculture until 1900. While in Washington, he discovered the enzyme catalase and carried out investigations on the influence of calcium and magnesium on plant development. He worked for a short time in Puerto Rico before settling back in Munich in 1910, where he was employed as private contractor working with soil bacteriological problems. In 1913 he accepted the position of professor of chemical plant physiology at the University of Munich.Loew was a versatile researcher and produced several significant technical papers on organic chemistry and enzyme theory. He invented a method to produce formaldehyde from methanol by oxidation with atmospheric oxygen and metallic copper as a catalyst. He proposed the name \'catalase\' for the enzyme that decomposes hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water. His work in this area focused on tobacco leaf extracts.In 1892 Loew observed that both calcium and magnesium can be toxic to plants when there is an excess of one and a deficiency of the other, thus suggesting there may be an optimal Ca:Mg ratio. In 1901, with D.W. May, he did further testing and suggested an ideal Ca:Mg ratio of 5 to 4, though for several species maximum growth was obtained across a wide range of ratios. This work was key to identifying the principle of cation exchange capacity and facilitating William Albrecht\'s later work on the Base Cation Saturation Ratio (BCSR), which is a method of interpreting soil test results that is now widely used in sustainable agriculture.Loew died in Berlin in 1940.

The plot revolves around Menlo Schwartzer, a maniacal mad scientist who creates a chemically altered soft drink which turns its drinkers into mutant zombie punks as part of a diabolical scheme to rid the beaches of surfers.Surf II is a contemporary parody of 1960s-style beach party films, mixing elements of the horror, science fiction, surf and teen film genres. Despite what the title implies, there was never a Surf I. Surf II was marketed with a number of subheadings, the most common of which was in fact Surf II: The End of the Trilogy. Although the film was received negatively by critics upon release and has never been officially released on DVD, it has since been rediscovered in recent years on VHS and YouTube, and is now considered a cult film.Plot.Deep in his secret underwater laboratory, teenage mad scientist Menlo Schwartzer plots to rid the beaches of his greatest enemies: surfers. Having been driven to revenge following a cruel practical joke gone awry, Menlo concocts an addictive chemical agent which turns its drinkers into mutated, garbage-ingesting zombie punks. With the reluctant help of his girlfriend Sparkle and a pair of greedy, cigar-chomping soda businessmen, Menlo distributes the chemical under the guise of Buzzz Cola, and one by one begins to build an army of brainless zombie slaves to do his bidding.After several of their friends fall victim to Buzzz Cola, airheaded surfer dudes Chuck and Bob begin to piece together the parts of Menlo\'s evil scheme. Finding no help from their spaced-out parents or the bumbling efforts of the local police force, the two enlist the services of their eccentric science teacher and vow to stop Menlo for good, or else they will not be able to compete in the big surf contest this weekend.Cast.The Untouchables appear as themselves during a beach party scene. Scream queen Brinke Stevens makes an uncredited cameo as a student.Production.Randall Badat claims that he conceived the idea for Surf II while being under the influence of heavy painkillers he was taking following a surfing injury. After being encouraged by friends to further develop the concept, Badat wrote the screenplay - originally titled Surf Trash - over a single weekend, basing many of the characters off people he knew directly from the So Cal surfer scene, including a man nicknamed Johnny Big Head. Badat wrote the role of Menlo Schwartzer specifically for Eddie Deezen, having been a fan of his performance in Robert Zemeckis\' 1978 film I Wanna Hold Your Hand. After completion, Badat showed the screenplay to producer George G. Braunstein, who agreed to help finance it, eventually selling the project to production company Arista Films at the Cannes Film Festival. Arista originally planned to film Surf II in 3-D; though several pre-production posters were made carrying the title Surf II 3-D, the idea was eventually scrapped.Surf II was filmed in 29 days during the summer of 1983. The beach scenes were shot at various locations throughout Malibu, Redondo Beach and Hermosa Beach, while interior shots were filmed at a studio in Culver City. Many of the comic actors were allowed to improvise their lines, and several of the odd props throughout the film were contributed by Deezen himself, including a baseball cap with an absurdly elongated brim and an oversized pair of novelty scissors. Among Surf II\'s crew were cinematographer Alex Phillips, Jr. (Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia), composer Peter Bernstein and Academy Award-winning make up artist Greg Cannom.Release and reception.Surf II was released theatrically in North America in January 1984. While originally marketed with the title Surf II: The End of the Trilogy, later promotions re-titled the film Surf II: The Nerds Strike Back, following the success of Revenge of the Nerds, which was released that summer. The film screened in Europe in the fall of 1984, retitled in Spain as Locura de playa (roughly translated as Beach Madness).Initial critical reviews of Surf II were overwhelmingly negative. In his Movie Guide, Leonard Maltin gave the film a 1.5 out of 5 star rating, writing that the best joke is its title - there never was a Surf I. Kim Newman quipped in the Monthly Film Bulletin, traditionally, sequels are never up to the standards of the original: Surf II, which is a sequel to nothing in particular, is therefore worse than anyone could possibly have imagined, calling it incoherent and most dreadful. The Chicago Tribune called it total trash and the Los Angeles Times simply remarked there was no Surf I - and with luck, there\'ll be no Surf III. In a more contemporary professional review, AllMovie, though having rated Surf II one star out of five, noted that the film is never dull and deranged enough to be memorable, giving praise to the performances of the ensemble cast and summarizing, Surf IIs unbalanced mix of amateurishness and gonzo humor will confound most viewers, but fans of B-movie weirdness will find more than enough memorable moments to keep themselves entertained.In spite of (or perhaps because of) its critical ravaging, Surf II has developed a following among cult film fans. Cult film website McBeardo\'s Midnight Movies ranked Surf II on its list of 15 Movies That Deserve Massive Cult Followings, calling the film serious competition for the position of the #1 most off-the-wall and ingenious teen sex comedy of the 80s. The Scarecrow Video Movie Guide, describes the film as [packing] more slapstick and early-80s drive-in mania into one movie than any sane mind could imagine, stating bluntly missing this movie would be like beating yourself in the face with a brick! Radioactive Reviews, a website specializing in reviewing The Movies That DVD Forgot, noted that Surf II doesn\'t make much sense and doesn\'t have much of a story, though the film creates an amusing, cartoonish world that\'s fun to watch, and would ultimately be of interest to lovers of [the 80s\'] sillier, less-coherent cinematic creations.On April 17, 2009, the New Beverly Cinema in Los Angeles presented a 25th anniversary screening of Surf II hosted by the Alamo Drafthouse, with Badat, Braunstein, Deezen and first assistant director D. Scott Easton in attendance. In 2010, Alamo Drafthouse programmers Zack Carlson and Bryan Connolly prominently featured Surf II in their book Destroy All Movies!!! The Complete Guide to Punks on Film, including interviews with Badat and Deezen. In an interview promoting the book, editor Connolly described Surf II as the ultimate \'80s party film.Home video.Surf II was released on VHS in January 1985 through Media Home Entertainment, who retained its distribution rights until ceasing operations in 1992. Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Surf II was occasionally shown on late night B-movie program USA Up All Night, and would sometimes be used as late night filler on HBO.Up All Nite Films released what is presumed to be an official DVD release, available in the US on Amazon.com in August 2012. The DVD is a manufactured on demand product similar to the Warner Archives versions of hard-to-find films. Due to the nature of the ad-hoc manufacturing, the DVD version availability is not limited to the stock of the initial print runs and is available as of June 2013.Soundtrack.Surf IIs soundtrack consists mainly of contemporary punk/New Wave hits and classic surf tunes. The producers had struck a deal with Capitol Records for the release of a soundtrack album, but as a result of the film\'s critical and financial disappointment, the project was ultimately abandoned.Danny Elfman of Oingo Boingo was briefly involved with the film\'s soundtrack production, contributing the exclusive track Hold Me Back, which has never been given an official release outside of Surf II.'),(13421162,'Greg_Cannom','Greg Cannom.Greg Cannom is a Hollywood special makeup effects artist.

The screenplay by Kazuo Kasahara adapts a series of newspaper articles by journalist Kichi Iiboshi, that were rewrites of a manuscript originally written by real-life yakuza Kz Min. It is the first film in a five-part series that Fukasaku made in a span of just two years.The violent, documentary-like film chronicles the underworld tribulations of Shozo Hirono (Bunta Sugawara), a young ex-soldier and street thug in post-war Hiroshima Prefecture. Starting in the open-air black markets of bombed-out Hiroshima in 1946, the film spans a period of more than ten years. The plot consists of a changing of the guard of new families and organizations with the same feuds and people, punctuated by the gritty violence.Battles Without Honor and Humanity won the 1974 Kinema Junpo Awards for Best Film, Best Actor (Bunta Sugawara) and Best Screenplay (Kazuo Kasahara). In 2009, the magazine named it fifth on a list of the Top 10 Japanese Films of All Time. Due to the series\' commercial and critical popularity it was followed by another three-part series, New Battles Without Honor and Humanity. The film is often called the Japanese Godfather, and marks a departure from traditional yakuza movies which had, for the most part, been tales of chivalry set in pre-war Japan. The overall tone of the series is bleak, violent and chaotic, expressing the futility of the struggles between yakuza families. In the western market it is also known under the titles, Tarnished Code of Yakuza (Australia), War Without a Code, and The Yakuza Papers.Plot.In Kure, Hiroshima 1946, when Shinichi Yamagata gets into a scuffle with a yakuza, his friend and fellow ex-soldier Shozo Hirono has the Yamamori family help get payback, but ends up killing the yakuza himself and is sent to prison. In prison, Hirono becomes sworn brothers with Doi family member Hiroshi Wakasugi, who ultimately has Yoshio Yamamori put up Hirono\'s bail. The Yamamori yakuza family was formed soon after, with Hirono, Yamagata, Tetsuya Sakai, Seiichi Kanbara, Uichi Shinkai, Masakichi Makihara and Shuji Yano swearing loyalty to Yoshio Yamamori. Boss Doi bore witness to the ceremony, with Kenichi Okubo as go-between.In 1949, Hirono gets into a fight with Toru Ueda at a gambling den. Because Ueda is a relative to Okubo, Hirono commits yubitsume in apology to Okubo. Okubo accepts but asks Yamamori to take Ueda into his family and perform a favor for assemblyman Shigeto Nakahara; eliminating a vote for his rival Shoichi Kanamaru who is supported by the Doi family. Sakai kidnaps a voter allowing Nakahara\'s side to win, but Doi finds out due to Kanbara bragging about it and goes after Yamamori. However, Wakasugi prevents bloodshed becoming a guest member of the Yamamori family, while Kanbara switches to Doi.Six months later, Doi starts breaking into Yamamori turf and plans to unite with the Kaito family in Hiroshima City. When the other Yamamori members back out, except Wakasugi whom Hirono will not let break yakuza code by killing his own boss, Hirono volunteers to kill Doi. While hiding out, Hirono is visited by Kanbara who claims Yamamori sent him to move Hirono elsewhere. However, it is actually a trick and Hirono has no choice but to turn himself in to police. Wakasugi assassinates Kanbara in revenge, but an anonymous tip to police leads to a raid of his hideout and he is killed.With the Korean War in 1950s, the Yamamori family thrives and expands in the immediate years, but internal strife begins when members start dealing philopon due to the high price the boss takes off their earnings. Sakai, who follows the boss\' orders not to sell, feuds with Shinkai when he discovers Shinkai\'s underling Toshio Arita is dealing the drug, but agrees Yamamori\'s take is too high. The family adopts Sakai\'s plan to each become self-sustaining, which results in a large drop in the boss\' funds, with only Shinkai and Yano objecting. Shinkai is contacted by Kanamaru to reform the Doi family and get rid of Sakai, and Yamagata is killed for tailing them and finding this out. When it is revealed that Yamamori is selling the drugs he confiscates from the other members for himself, Sakai and Ueda threaten the boss that without them he would be nothing. Yamamori has Ueda killed by Arita and a war breaks out, with Sakai the victor after Arita is arrested and Shinkai killed.Hirono is then paroled due to a commutation of sentence, with Yamamori lying to him to get him to kill Sakai. Hirono decides to hear Sakai out first, by asking Sakai to make peace with Yamamori and build the family again. But Sakai instead forces Yamamori to retire and forms a company with plans to unite with the Kaito family. When Makihara informs Sakai that Yano plans to get to the Kaito family first, Sakai has him killed. Makihara then contacts Hirono to join him on the supposedly retired Yamamori\'s side, however, Hirono refuses and instead announces he is breaking off his pledge to Yamamori just before realizing that it was them who tipped the police off to Wakasugi. He then goes to see Sakai and announces they are no longer brothers, and they each vow to kill the other, although Sakai let\'s Hirono go for now, he is assassinated immediately after by Makihara\'s men. At Sakai\'s funeral, which has Makihara and Yamamori in attendance, Hirono shoots up the service before threatening Yamamori and storming off.Production.The Battles Without Honor and Humanity screenplay by Kazuo Kasahara adapts a series of articles by journalist Kichi Iiboshi that ran in Shukan Sunday, that were rewrites of a manuscript originally written by real-life yakuza Kz Min while he was in prison. The memoirs detail a yakuza conflict in Hiroshima. When Kasahara and producer Goro Kusakabe first asked Min for permission to adapt his story, he declined not wanting to receive further scorn from his fellow gang members, which he had already received for exposing the inner workings of the lifestyle. However, they eventually succeeded in getting permission, with help from the fact that Min and Kasahara both served in the same unit of the Japanese navy. Fukasaku biographer Sadao Yamane stated that Kasahara strictly researched by meeting with Min and going to Hiroshima to interview everyone mentioned in the book. He also learned other stories not in the memoir that he inserted into the screenplay.Lead actor Bunta Sugawara claims that he had the initial idea to adapt the memoirs to film. He said that six months before the movie was released, he was on the cover of Shukan Sunday with Tatsuo Umemiya and read this issue that also contained the first installment of the series while on the Shinkansen. Upon arriving in Kyoto he gave it to Toei producer Koji Shundo and told him to read it. Days later, after Shundo still had not done so, Sugawara bought another copy and insisted again. The actor asked Shundo to cast him in an adaptation, with Goro Kusakabe producing and Kinji Fukasaku directing.When Shundo selected Fukasaku to direct he received backlash from his Toei colleagues, who felt the director could not make the film interesting or commercial enough. Shundo himself did not like Fukasaku\'s earlier films, stating that he made them for his own enjoyment only, but changed his mind after seeing 1972\'s Street Mobster. According to Yamane, Kasahara was against the selection of Fukasaku. The two had worked together previously and fought over a story Fukasaku disliked, although the two eventually worked over it, the director left the project due to ill health. However, when Fukasaku read the Battles Without Honor and Humanity script he said he would not change a thing and the film was green lit.Set in post-war Japan, Fukasaku drew on his experiences as a child during World War II for Battles Without Honor and Humanity. At fifteen he worked with other children in a munitions factory that was regularly bombed. The director recalled even though we were friends working together, the only thing we would be thinking of was self-preservation. We would try to get behind each other or beneath dead bodies to avoid the bombs... I also had to clean up all the dead bodies... I\'m sure those experiences have influenced the way I look at violence. The film, noted for its extreme violence, opens with Japanese soldiers, during America\'s occupation of their country, stealing food and murdering for a bowl of rice. Using hand-held camera, zoom lenses and natural lighting to create a gritty, chaotic look, the director showed his generation\'s struggle to survive in the post-war chaos. The shaky camera technique has since become a trademark of the director.Toei producer Masao Sato remarked that unusually Fukasaku shot the film in Toei\'s Kyoto studio, despite being under contract to Toei Tokyo. He also stated that the entire filming process was short, hectic and chaotic, taking only 35 to 40 days. Upon filming on location in Kure, many yakuza, including those used as models for characters in the film, gathered on set. They gave advice to both the director and actors; decades later, Tatsuo Umemiya who plays Hiroshi Wakasugi, stated that he felt sorry for actors playing yakuza today because they don\'t have the chance to get to know real yakuza the way we did. Producer Shundo himself was formerly a yakuza before getting a job at Toei.Yamane and Kenta Fukasaku both agreed that the series does not focus on specific lead actors, but is an ensemble piece with the supporting actors energizing it. The stars are narrative characters, with the low-ranking yakuza that are endlessly killed off the real focus of the movies. Sugawara said that this was the first Toei, and even the first Japanese, film to not have the lead actors in every scene.Release.Battles Without Honor and Humanity has been released on home video and aired on television, the latter with some scenes cut. In 1980, the first four films were edited into a 224-minute compilation and was given a limited theatrical release and broadcast on Toei\'s TV network. A Blu-ray box set compiling all five films in the series was released on March 21, 2013 to celebrate its 40th anniversary.All five films in the series were released on DVD in North America by Home Vision Entertainment in 2004, under the moniker The Yakuza Papers. A 6-disc DVD box set containing them all was also released. It includes a bonus disc containing interviews with director William Friedkin, discussing the influence of the films in America; subtitle translator Linda Hoaglund, discussing her work on the films; David Kaplan, Kenta Fukasaku, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, a Toei producer and a biographer among others. Arrow Films released a Blu-ray box set, limited to 2,500 copies, of all five films in the UK on December 7, 2015 and in the US a day later. Special features include an interview with the series fight choreographer Ryuzo Ueno and the 1980 edited compilation of the first four films.Reception and legacy.Battles Without Honor and Humanity won three awards at the 1974 Kinema Junpo Awards; the Reader\'s Choice for Best Film, Bunta Sugawara received Best Actor, and Best Screenplay for Kazuo Kasahara. In 2009, the magazine named it fifth on an aggregated list of the Top 10 Japanese Films of All Time as voted by over one hundred film critics and writers. Previous editions of the list had the series at number twenty-two in 1995 and eighth in 1999, tied with Twenty-Four Eyes. In 2011, Complex named it number one on their list of The 25 Best Yakuza Movies. Jasper Sharp, writing for the British Film Institute, listed it as one of the 10 great Japanese gangster movies.The film is credited as one of the first modern yakuza films; prior, movies about yakuza were known as Ninky eiga, chivalry films, and set in pre-war Japan. The A.V. Club\'s Noel Murray states that Fukasaku\'s yakuza instead only adhere to codes of honor when it\'s in their best interest, but otherwise bully and kill indiscriminately. Dennis Lim of the Village Voice writes Fukasaku\'s yakuza flicks drain criminal netherworlds of romance, crush codes of honor underfoot, and nullify distinctions between good and evil. Film scholar Richard Torrance suggests that the film acts as a microcosm of the broader society and international order of the post-war period, in which violence lacks moral significance and exists without heroes. This new yakuza film genre became known as Jitsuroku eiga (actual record film), often depicting events based on true stories.Fukasaku biographer Sadao Yamane believes Battles Without Honor and Humanity was popular because of the time of its release; Japan\'s economic growth was at its peak and at the end of the 1960s the student uprisings took place. The young people had similar feelings to those of the post-war society depicted in the films. Yamane also stated that for the rest of his career Fukasaku was approached many times by producers to create movies similar to Battles, but always turned them down wanting to move on to films he found interesting.American director William Friedkin stated that Fukasaku\'s trait of never redeeming bad characters and not catering to have the good guys win in the end was a profound influence on himself. He went on to claim that this is something one cannot do today in American films.A restored version of the film, from a 4K 35mm print original negative to 2K digital by Toei Labo Tech, was screened at the Cannes Classics section of the 2015 Cannes Film Festival.'),(22290537,'Conus_aulicus','Conus aulicus.Conus aulicus, common name the princely cone, is a species of a predatory sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Conidae, the cone snails, cone shells or cones.Description.The size of an adult shell varies between 65mm and 163mm.

She graduated as class valedictorian from Clear Lake High School, in Clear Lake, Iowa in 1886. She entered the didactics program at the Iowa State Normal School in Cedar Falls, and graduated with a bachelor\'s degree in 1893.In the 1890s, Wiers family left Iowa and moved to Heppner, Oregon, where she was an assistant principal of the high school from 1893 to 1895. In that year Wier began her studies at Stanford University, where she majored in history, studying under Professor George Elliott Howard. In 1897 she began field work for her thesis in in northern Nevada studying the Washoe Indians.Nevada State University.In 1899, Anne Henrietta Martin, who had been teaching in the history department of Nevada State University, requested a leave of absence from the board of regents. In her request she requested Jeanne Wier to serve as her replacement. Wier, still a few credits short of graduation, arrived in Nevada in September, 1899 where she was appointed acting Assistant Professor of History in charge of the Department of History. The timing of Wiers arrival was marked by a period of growth and expansion for the university, under the leadership of President Joseph Edward Stubbs.When Martin returned from her leave of absence in 1901, Wier was offered a permanent position in the history department, while Martin taught only a small selection of classes. In September 1901, Wier also completed her thesis and received her master\'s degree from Stanford. In November, the Board of Regents approved her appointment as Assistant Professor of History in charge of the Department of History and Political Science with an annual salary of $1200. Wier remained the only faculty member in the department until 1913. While teaching in the history department, Wier supervised Effie Mona Mack\'s Masters thesis in history.During her early tenure at the university, Wier became move active in the Reno community.

Church, G.H. True, and President Stubbs. Wier would hold the title of executive secretary, or secretary and curator from that meeting until her death in 1950. Although the leadership of the historical society was largely made up of University faculty, and was closely associated with it, it was never classed as an affiliated organization.The first activity of the society was to solicit support and membership across the state. Wier wrote to prominent individuals and early pioneer families, soliciting their support in the historical society. From 1904 until 1907, when the historical society became a state agency, Wier sought individual memberships as the primary means of financial support for the new society. Even after becoming officially supported by the state of Nevada, the society had no permanent home until 1911, when the state appropriated $5000 towars the construction of a building, completed in 1913. Prior to this, Wier stored all of the societys materials in her own home.In addition to letters of solicitation, Wier went out on collecting trips across the state to procure early newspapers, manuscripts, photographs, maps, books, Indian materials, and artifacts from earlier settlement and mining periods. An early important collection Wier managed to acquire in an 1908 trip were the papers of William Morris Stewart, one of Nevada\'s first senators. In her first biennial report of the historical society in 1908, Weir explained the importance of such trips. No permanent success can be achieved by this organization until there is at least one person in each community who has a sympathetic knowledge of the work which we plan to do. Correspondence has failed to accomplish this end. But many a person who had been irresponsive to letters became interested and even enthusiastic when visited in person.In the 1920s the societies first building was already inadequate for the storage and access of its historical collections. Wier asked the legislature for additional appropriations without success. In 1933, Wier received assistance from the Works Progress Administration to have needed repairs done to the building. Following World War 2, the legislature increased its funding for the historical society. But it would not be until after Wiers death in 1950, that the Nevada Historical Society received a new building in 1960.'),(9902743,'Wounded_Bird_Records','Wounded Bird Records.Wounded Bird Records is a CD only, re-issue record label, that was founded in 1998 in Guilderland, New York.

Recent cladistic analyses of nuclear, mitochondrial, and plastid gene sequences place this monophyletic group as the basal sister group to all other liverworts. The group thus provides a unique insight into the early evolution of liverworts in particular and of land plants in general.Description.Plants of Treubia grow as a prostrate leafy thallus. The bifid leaves extend like wings on either side of the midrib, or may be folded upwards and pressed close together, giving the plants a ruffled appearance. By contrast, Haplomitrium grows as a subterranean rhizome with erect leafy stems. The thin, rounded leaves are arranged around the upright stems, giving the appearance of a soft moss. The species Haplomitrium ovalifolium of Australia often has bifid leaves that are asymmetrical, somewhat like those in Treubia.Haplomitrium has a number of unique characters that distinguish it from other liverworts, such as lacking rhizoids. The vegetative stems possess a central water-conducting strand with large perforations derived from plasmodesmata. This central strand is surrounded by a cylinder of cells that conduct food throughout the plant. Such an arrangement is evocative of the xylem and phloem found in vascular plants. Although some thalloid liverwort species in the Pallaviciniaceae also possess a central conducting strand, Haplomitrium differs in having a food-conducting layer and in producing no callose.Treubia also has features that differ from those found in other bryophytes, such as the differentiation of five identifiable zones in the stem midrib. Unlike other leafy species, the oil bodies in its cells are restricted to certain clusters of cells, as they are in the Marchantiopsida. These oil body clusters appear as dark spots in the leaves when the plant is held up to the light.Diversity.Living representatives of the group exhibit an essentially Gondwanan distribution with its center of diversity in Australasia. Such a distribution implies that the modern genera radiated prior to the beginning of the Cretaceous when Gondwana broke apart. Schuster proposes that species distributed in the northern hemisphere rafted on the Indian subcontinent to Asia, then spread across the Bering Strait into North America.Most species in the Haplomitriopsida are found in south of the equator, though there are northern ones. The genus Treubia is restricted to the southern hemisphere, while Apotreubia has one species in New Guinea and another disjunct between eastern Asia and British Columbia. The genus Haplomitrium exhibits a wider distribution, with species in both North and South America, northern and central Europe, the Himalayas, Japan, and Australasia.Classification.An additional fossil Treubiites kidstonii previously has been compared to the extant genus Treubia. However, upon re-examination of the material, specimens were determined to be more like Blasia and not at all to resemble Treubia as previously thought. Accordingly, Treubiites is now assigned to the Blasiales rather than the Haplomitriopsida.'),(4924062,'Qaisrani','Qaisrani.Qaisrani () Also spelled as (Kaisrani or Kasrani) is a Baloch tribe in Balochistan, Pakistan. The Qaisranis claim their ancestry from Mir Qaiser Khan Rind who was the nephew of Mir Chakar Khan Rind.Location.The majority of the tribe occupies the northernmost territory of the District of Dera Ghazi Khan, Panjab, Pakistan and its adjacent tribal areas in the Suleiman Mountains. Important centers of the tribe include Kot Qaisrani, Baharwali, Baathi Qaisrani (Basti Dhammani near the north side of Bathi Darrah), Shehlani East and West Jhoke Bodo, Balchani (Baloo Khan and Khatta Khan), Vehova, Retra Qaisrani, Batkel Qaisrani, nawab Qaisrani rakh more jhangi and Tibbi Qaisrani (near indus highway). Qaisranis are also found in Jaffarabad, Balochistan and in Kohlu and Musakhel, Balochistan. In Sindh, their main villages are Goth Qaisrani, Goth Sodho and Baharkhan Mirjat at TandoAllahyar. The Nizamani tribe in Sindh is a breakaway section of the Qaisrani tribe.

Which are further divided into 42 clans. The Dilshadani family of the Khobdein section has been the chief family for the last ten generations.Qaisranis are one of the prominent Baloch tribes residing and settled mainly in the D G Khan District of Punjab, Musakhel Balochistan and D I Khan in NWFP. According to last population census, the Qaisranis are a main stream baloch tribe populating around 175,000. Some of the clans reside in the D G Khan Tribal Area having its provincial borders with NWFP and Balochistan. Qaisranis trace back their history from one Qaiser Khan who was one of the nephew of Sardar Mir Chakar Khan Rind(14681565) who was a Baloch King in the 15th century. Mir Chakar Khan founded a kingdom which however proved to be short-lived because of a civil war between the Lashari and Rind tribes of Balochistan. Mir Chakar Khan Rind gave a strong support to the Mughal army of Emperor Humayun and was rewarded by Humayun after his reconquest to the throne in 1555.Mir Chakar Khan Rind lived in Sevi (modern time Sibi) in hills of Balochistan and became the head of Rind tribe after the death of his father Mir Shahak Khan at the age of 18. Mir Chakar Khan Rind is regarded as one of the great Baloch heroes and is the center of Balochi love and war ballad. A natural leader and warrior, Mir Chakar Khan Rind was a man with resolute determination.When Mir Chakar started his conquest towards Punjab, some of the elders of the Rind Tribe established and settled alongside the River Indus and the Koh e Suleman Range covering the entire Western border of Punjab. These elders were all Rind Baloch and later became the founding members of the current tribes i.e. the Legharis, Mazaris, Khosas, Qaisranis, Dareshaks, Gurchanis, Buzdars. The elder Qaiser Khan Rind, from where the Qaisrani Tribe segregates from the mainstream Rind tribe was a warrior and known to be the bravest amongst the then elders of Rind Baloch Tribe. After Mir Qaiser Khan, the tribal traditional system of Sardarism continued throughout the years of history. These tribals used to have an elected Chief, the Sardar of the tribe as per their traditional systems of Muqadamins and Jirgas until the advent of British, who somehow maneuvered to control these Tribals by introducing the system of hereditary title for the Chief. Whenever a Chief died, his elder son was crowned as the Chief of Tribe. The British had established Chiefs College specifically for these sons of existing Chiefs of Baloch, Punjabi, Sindhi and Pakhtoon Tribes to induce a blend of British allegiance right from the childhood.Qaisranis were the only baloch tribe in District D G Khan and Rajanpur which resisted and fought against the British to safeguard their culture, traditions and allegiance to the soil. Sardar Mir Mitha Khan Qaisrani was the last elected Chief of the Qaisrani Tribe. Sardar Mir Kaura Khan of Tibbi Qaisrani was another heroic figure of his time. After Mitha Khan, his son Sardar Mir Fazal Ali Khan was made chief of tribe. Sardar Mir Fazal Ali Khan lived a long life, had seven wives and five sons. The eldest son was Sardar Mir Allah Bakhsh Khan Qaisrani but he died in his life and his son named Sardar Mir Mehmood Khan Qaisrani was made chief by the British. Sardar Mir Mehmood Khan was later impeached by the tribe and the British and the second eldest son of Sardar Mir Fazal Ali Khan i.e. Sardar Imam Bakhsh Khan Qaisrani was crowned as chief by the British. During the life of Sardar Imam Baksh Khan, his elder son Sardar Shamsher khan died leaving one son Mir Manzoor Ahmed Khan who was then just two years old.Thus, Sardar Mir Muhammad Khan Qaisrani, son of Sardar Mir Imam Baksh Khan was crowned as Chief and Tumandar. Sardar Mir Mohammad Khan had two wives and five sons. During his time, the Qaisrani tribe was re-organised to regain its lost strength and dignity. He was given the title of Khan Bahadur by the British. He was one of the most prominent member of Joint Jirga of Baloch Sardars headed by Khan of Kalat and was well known amongst the other Baloch tribal chiefs including Bugti, Marri and Mazari. Sardar Ameer Muhammad Khan Qaisrani was the last official and recognized Chief of Qaisrani Tribe since in 1974 Z.A. Bhutto abolished the system of Sardarism and Tumandaarism. After the abolishing of Sardarism in 1974, Sardar Ameer Muhammad Khan instead of crowning any of his son as Chief opted to crown his nephew and his son in law, Sardar Manzoor Ahmed Khan as Chief of Qaisrani tribe. After the death of Sardar Manzoor Ahmed Khan, his son Sardar Zahoor Ahmed Khan became Chief of Qaisrani tribe and currently the tribe is split between tribal leadership of Sardar Mir Badshah Qaisrani, the grandson of Sardar Manzoor Ahmed Qaisrani, and Barrister Sardar Imam Baksh Qaisrani, the grandson of Sardar Ameer Muhammad Qaisrani, both considered as Chiefs of Qaisrani Tribe. Despite the fact that Sardar Meer Badshah Qaisrani has a political edge since he is Member of Provincial Assembly and has defeated Sardar Imam Baksh Qaisrani in General Elections, still in the tribal capacity, Sardar Imam Baksh Qaisrani holds the majority of Sub-Clans of Qaisrani Tribe in his support.The other prominent personalities of the Kot Qaisrani were Khan Bahadur Muhammad Yar Khan Qaisrani, who was an Assistant Commissioner in government of British India. His son Khan Bahadur[Awarded in 1946] Khan Sahib Muhammad Nawaz Khan Qaisrani served in I.C.S and served the government of Pakistan as Political Agent in Waziristan and Khyber Agency. Brigadier Arshad Hussain Qaisrani son of Major Muhammad Hussain Qaisrani [late] (both of the Guides Infantry / Corps of Guides) also served the nation in Pakistan Army.The Qaisranis are generally regarded as a Tribe of Talent in Baloch race. However, it has been widely observed that there exist staunch adherence to the tribal traditions which are still very much practiced and are strongly established.Qaisrani Tribal Area has also proven to be one of the richest in natural resources. Although less in reserves capacity than the Bugti Area, the Qaisrani Tribal Area has Petroleum and Gas Production at Dhodak owned and controlled by OGDC. Moreover, Uranium Production is also being carried out in the Qaisrani Area. Petroleum Exploration is also being carried out at Rodho on wells which were abandoned by OGDCL in the 1970s.'),(12251708,'Ingvar_Lidholm','Ingvar Lidholm.Ingvar Natanael Lidholm (born 24 February 1921) is a Swedish composer.Early years: 19211940.Ingvar Lidholm was born in Jnkping. The actual family home was in Nssj, some 40 kilometers to the southeast. Neither of his parents was particularly musical: his father worked for Swedish Railways and his mother was a homemaker. But the home environment was one in which music was encouraged. Ingvar was the youngest of four children, all of whom made music at home. The family owned a piano, and Lidholm began his musical explorations at an early age. By the age of eleven, Lidholm and his family had moved to Sdertlje, which lies to the south of Stockholm. Both at school and at home, he rapidly began to develop his musical skills as a performer  and as a composer. By age twelve, he was writing songs in a tonal and romantic idiom, which led gradually to exercises of larger proportions, including music for full orchestra. This early period also included orchestration studies with Natanael Berg in Stockholm.Lidholms primary performance area was stringed instruments; he eventually studied and mastered all four instruments of the string family. As a gymnasium student, he played viola and contrabass in the school orchestra, and studied violin from the German master Hermann Gramss. He remained active in composition throughout his school years and completed what may be considered his final student work early in 1940: the Elegisk svit (Elegiac Suite) for string quartet. Several songs he wrote later that summer (including Fr vilsna ftter sjunger grset) were to become his earliest published pieces.In 1940, Lidholm completed his studies at the gymnasium and passed the Studentexamen, the standard prerequisite test for higher education in Sweden.University: 19401947.With the fall of 1940, Lidholm began his advanced musical studies at the Musikhgskolan in Stockholm. There, he established friendships with two other students at the conservatory who were to become important composers in their own right: Sven-Erik Bck and Karl-Birger Blomdahl. Over the following decades, these three men were to hold similar, and influential, posts at Swedish Radio (the state broadcasting organization) and the Musikhgskola. They, in turn, were to affect the growth and education of many younger Swedish composers and musicians.As students with common interests, Lidhom, Bck and Blomdahl began to meet together, eventually more regularly, and it came about that their gatherings fell on Mondays. Additional students, and then instructors, began to drop in; they held critiques and discussions of music, as well as performances of contemporary works. Hilding Rosenberg, who was to be Lidholms composition teacher for two years, was especially important in leading studies into Hindemith, Stravinsky and other modern composers. Thus evolved what was later to be called the Mndagsgrup. Under Rosenberg, Lidholm began to achieve a higher compositional output than previously, including: incidental music to a play of Georg Bchner, Leonce och Lena, from which the song Rosettas visa was published separately; Madonnas vaggvisa (The Madonnas Cradle Song) for voice and piano; and P kungens slott (At the Kings Castle), a collection of childrens piano pieces. A further teaching piece for piano, Allegro-Koral-Risoluto, followed the next year.The early part of summer of 1944, he completed Toccata e Canto for a chamber orchestra of strings and solo winds. With its debut, this work of the twenty-one-year-old composer attracted immediate interest within Swedish music circles. The following year, he wrote the Concerto for string orchestra, and in 1946 a Sonata for solo flute.Lidholm spent the academic year 1946/47 abroad as the recipient of a governmental Jenny Lind scholarship, during which he broadened his artistic experiences, meeting people, discussing ideas, and planning compositions. While in Bergen, Norway, he wrote the Sonata for piano, dedicated to musicologist and pianist Ingmar Bengtsson.He auditioned and was accepted for the position of musical director of the rebro Orchestral Society in 1947, a position he held until 1956. (His work Mutanza was written in 1959 for the society.)New compositional directions: 19471956.I remember so well our first contact with Lidholms Laudi  how depressed we were after the first rehearsal. We understood nothing! The piece appeared like a high wall! But we struggled through and in that way taught ourselves not just Laudi but many other pieces... What had been very difficult gradually became natural. Laudi was the first of Lidholms works to be performed at a convocation of the International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM), at Brussels in 1950.In 1949, he attended seminars on music held at the Darmstdter Ferienkurse in Germany (including lectures by Leibowitz on twelve-tone technique, and talks by Messiaen and Fortner). Shortly after returning from Darmstadt, Lidholm wrote a brief piano work, Klavierstck 1949. It is not directly inspired by Arnold Schoenbergs similarly titled piano piece, but Lidholm was familiar with it. Fyra krer (Four choruses) from 1953 also uses a free application of twelve-tone technique.In late 1953, Lidholm pursued further compositional studies with Mtys Seiber in London for several months. Work from this period includes the Invention for various instrumental combinations and Concertino, a 13-minute chamber work he wrote upon the commission of the Guildhall Music Society. During his time in London, Lidholm made contact with Messiaen and Luigi Dallapiccola. Within a year after his return to Sweden, Lidholm had completed a suite for cello and piano that pays tribute to Dallapiccola, and Lidholm produced his first large-scale orchestral work, Ritornell, in 1955, the piece with which he became internationally known. Lidholm remarked After some years of mainly working with chamber music, I desired to test my abilities in a work for larger ensemble. It made use of large cluster chords and protracted use of percussion.In the ensuing years, Lidholms works were performed in different cities, especially within Sweden and Germany.Lidholm, in his prefatory remarks on his compositional style in Ritornell, quoted Igor Stravinskys definition of music as a spirits free investigation. He composed in a number of styles of the course of his career, but never keyed his music to a methodology within any one of those styles. Thus, there is not the systematization of Hindemith in his works from the forties, or a strict serial technique in his works of the fifties. Only a small percentage of Lidholm\'s serial music subscribes to strict pitch order throughout the work. In Ritornell, for example, extraneous pitches are freely integrated into row order, and there is no deliberate effort to maintain an atonal orientation.International recognition: 19561960.In 1956, Lidholm left his conducting post in rebro to assume the head of the Chamber Music Department at Swedish Radio. He was instrumental in establishing the periodical Nutida music (Contemporary Music) as an adjunct to the music series of the same name begun in 1957 by Swedish Radio. It was at this time that he came into contact with electronic music. In the fall of 1957, he made a visit to the Studio di Fonologia Musicale in Milan, and by 1959 he had produced his first electronic composition, as an accompaniment to his ballet, Riter; its electronic tape segments were somewhat akin to Blomdahls opera Aniara of the same year. The tapes served to augment and accompany the orchestral forces. Riter was written for Birgit kesson (who also choreographed Bcks A Game Around a Game in 1959). Later, he aided in establishing an independent electronic music laboratory for the Musikhgskola.Skaldens natt (The Poet\'s Night) from 1957 was not a commissioned work, receiving its premier in Hamburg in 1959 as part of the West German new music series, Das neue Werk. The piece won first prize in the ISCM international composition competition at Rome.He contributed a good deal toward an original and important a cappella choir literature during the second half of the 1950s. The first of these works was Canto LXXXI in 1956, whose text is an excerpt of the canto of the same name by Ezra Pound. The twelve-tone series used for Canto LXXXI was later used in a series of other choral works from 1959 to form an A cappella-bok (A Cappella Book) collection.The first part of 1960 was devoted to the composition of Motus-colores for orchestra, commissioned by the Sdwestfunk Orchestra of Baden-Baden, for large chamber orchestra with dominating percussion. The pitch content was organized serially, but with just nine, not twelve, pitches to the row, plus the inversion of that row. Following Motus-colores, Lidholm did not produce any compositions for the next two years.Moving away from serial music: 1963 and beyond.A distinctly new era begins in 1963, when Lidholm abandoned serial principles of pitch organization in his two works from that year: Nausikaa ensam (Nausicaa Alone) and Poesis. In writing Nausikaa, Lidholm had to take into consideration of the performance abilities of the commissioning body, the orchestra of the music high school of Ingesund, Sweden. Poesis, on the other hand, was commissioned for the fiftieth anniversary of the Stockholm Philharmonic Orchestra. Lidholms inaugural lecture at the Musikhogskola describes the process of writing Poesis. One of the distinguishing characteristics of Poesis is its graphic notation, due to Lidholms abandonment of even loose pitch serialization. In keeping with the works of other composers who introduce new graphical notations, there are several pages of explanatory notes as a preface to the score. This was Lidholms first composition with newer-style notation, but certainly not his last: In 1971, he composed Stamp music. This celebrated a stamp issue which honored the 200th anniversary of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music.In 1964, Lidholm decided to leave his post at Swedish Radio and succeed Karl-Birger Blomdahl as professor composition (a ten-year, non-renewable appointment) at the Musikhogskola. Due to his teaching duties, he produced just four works for the period 1965-1975. He began exploring the challenges of a medium for which he had not yet written, opera. Together with his librettist, Herbert Grevenius, he settled on reworking an unfinished drama of August Strindberg, Hollndarn (The Dutchman). This was a joint commission from Swedish Radio-RV and West German Television, which meant that the opera was to be not for the stage, but for television, the first such work by a Scandinavian composer. Premiered in December, 1967, it captured the opera prizes of Florence and Salzburg in 1968.In 1973, he completed a commission from the governmental arts board of Sweden, Rikskonserter, for an a cappella choral work, a riveder le stelle, in which rhythm is subordinated to allow for maximal exposure of the harmony and melody, using whole-tone and pentatonic as well as diatonic pitch organization. Its serenity stands in contrast to the work that followed it, Greetings from an old world, commissioned by the Clarion Music Society of New York City in 1976. The old world of the title is brought into play through the use of Heinrich Isaacs tune, Innsbruck, Ich muss dich lassen. The overall effect of this stylistic mixture is reminiscent of Charles Ives, and other Scandinavian composers such as Lars Johan Werle and Lars Edlund who have utilized tonal and atonal styles within the same piece.In 1978, Lidholm completed a commission for another choral work, Perserna (The Persians), adapted from Aeschylus play of the same name, and set for a cappella male choir and three soloists. This was followed the same year by Kontakion, in which he uses Russian Orthodox choral music, again as with Greetings from an old world bridging early music and the avant-garde.His second opera, Ett drmspel (1992) is based on Strindberg\'s A Dream Play.In 1993, Ingvar Lidholm won the Rolf Schock Prize. He plays the violin and viola, and has been a conductor and has served on musical juries. His notable students include Edward Applebaum and Anders Eliasson.'),(21185193,'Salonenque','Salonenque.The Salonenque, carrying the name of Salon-de-Provence, is a cultivar of olives grown primarily in Provence. Though it is used for producing oil, and gives a good yield, it is valued primarily as a table olive. It is produced as a so-called cracked olive, which means that the fruit is cracked to speed up the curing process.Extent.The Salonenque is particularly common in Provence, especially in the Bouches-du-Rhne. In the Valle des Baux it makes up over 60% of planted trees (as of 2004). It is also grown in South Australia, primarily in the area around Adelaide.Synonyms.The cultivar is also known locally under several other names, including Courgeole, Plant de Salon, Salonen, Sauren, Sauzen, Selounen and Varagen.Characteristics.It is a cultivar of weak vigour, with an erect growth form. The leaves are short and narrow, with an elliptic-lanceolate form. The olives are of medium-high weight, and of an ovoid quite symmetrical shape. They are rounded both at the apex and the base. The stone has a rugose, or wrinkled surface, with a rounded apex, a pointed base, and a mucro.For use as table olives, the fruit is harvested relatively early, around 10 September. For oil production the harvest is later, in early November. When fully mature, the colour of the fruit is bright green.Processing.The primary use of the Salonenque is as a table olive, more specifically as cracked olives (olives that are slit during the curing for the process to go faster). They cured olives are fresh with a firm, meaty texture and a whiff of aromatic fennel. It is also used for production of oil, and gives a high yield (2225%). The taste of the oil is sweet and delicate, and quite strong. The olive is freestonethe stone does not cling to the flesh. The Salonenque is used in several officially approved appellations: such as AOC Valle des Baux and AOC Pays d\'Aix.Agronomy.Salonenque is considered a cultivar of high and constant production, but has a low rooting ability. The Salonenque is partially self-fertile, but it can take advantage of nearby pollinators, among which are the Grossane and the Berruguette.It has a high level of resistance to the major pests, with the exception of grubs of the olive moth Prays oleae and of the olive fruit fly Bactrocera oleae. It has a good resistance also to cold, and can sustain temperatures down to 15 C, but it is highly sensitive to wind.'),(27478700,'Douglas_MacArthur_in_World_War_II','Douglas MacArthur in World War II.General of the Army Douglas MacArthur (January 26, 1880  April 5, 1964) was an American general and field marshal of the Philippine Army. He was a Chief of Staff of the United States Army during the 1930s and played a prominent role in the Pacific theater during World War II. He received the Medal of Honor for his service in the Philippines Campaign.MacArthur was recalled to active duty in 1941 as commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East. A series of disasters followed, starting with the destruction of his air force on December 8, 1941, and the invasion of the Philippines by the Japanese. MacArthur\'s forces were soon compelled to withdraw to Bataan, where they held out until May 1942. In March 1942, MacArthur, his family and his staff left Corregidor in PT boats, and escaped to Australia, where MacArthur became Supreme Commander, Southwest Pacific Area. For his defense of the Philippines, MacArthur was awarded the Medal of Honor. After more than two years of fighting in the Pacific, he fulfilled a promise to return to the Philippines. He officially accepted Japan\'s surrender on September 2, 1945.Philippines Campaign (194142).On July 26, 1941 Roosevelt federalized the Philippine Army, recalled MacArthur to active duty in the U.S. Army as a two star/major general, and named him commander of U.S. Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE). MacArthur was promoted to lieutenant general the following day, and then to general on December 20. At the same time, Sutherland was promoted to major general, while Marshall, Spencer B. Akin, and Hugh John Casey were all promoted to brigadier general. On July 31, 1941 the Philippine Department had 22,000 troops assigned, 12,000 of whom were Philippine Scouts. The main component was the Philippine Division, under the command of Major General Jonathan M. Wainwright. Between July and December 1941 the garrison received 8,500 reinforcements. After years of parsimony, much equipment was shipped. By November, a backlog of 1,100,000 shipping tons of equipment intended for the Philippines had accumulated in U.S. ports and depots awaiting vessels.At 0330 local time on December 8, 1941, Sutherland learned of the attack on Pearl Harbor and informed MacArthur. At 0530, Chief of Staff of the United States Army General George Marshall ordered MacArthur to execute the existing war plan, Rainbow Five. MacArthur did nothing. When, on three occasions, Gen. Breteron requested permission to attack Japanese bases in Formosa (now called Taiwan), in accordance with prewar intentions, he was refused. At 12:30, the Japanese pilots of the 11th Air Fleet achieved complete tactical surprise when they attacked Clark Field and the nearby fighter base at Iba Field. They destroyed or disabled 18 of Far East Air Force\'s 35 B-17s, 53 of its 107 P-40s, three P-35s, and more than 25 other aircraft. Substantial damage was done to the bases, and casualties totaled 80 killed and 150 wounded. What was left of the Far East Air Force was all but destroyed over the next few days.Prewar defense plans assumed the Japanese could not be prevented from landing on Luzon and called for U.S. and Filipino forces to abandon Manila and retreat with their supplies to the Bataan peninsula. MacArthur attempted to slow the Japanese advance with an initial defense against the Japanese landings. However, he reconsidered his confidence in the ability of his Filipino troops when the Japanese landing force made a rapid advance after landing at Lingayen Gulf on December 21. He subsequently ordered a retreat to Bataan. Manila was declared an open city and on December 25 MacArthur moved his headquarters to the island fortress of Corregidor in Manila Bay. A series of air raids by the Japanese destroyed all the exposed structures on the island and USAFFE headquarters was moved into the Malinta Tunnel. Later most of the headquarters moved to Bataan, leaving only the nucleus with MacArthur. The troops on Bataan knew that they had been written off but continued to fight. Some blamed Roosevelt and MacArthur for their predicament. A ballad sung to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic called him Dugout Doug. However, most clung to the belief that somehow MacArthur would reach down and pull something out of his hat.On January 1, 1942 MacArthur was offered and accepted a payment of $500,000 ($ million in current value) from President Quezon of the Philippines as payment for his pre-war service. MacArthur\'s staff members also received payments: $75,000 for Sutherland, $45,000 for Richard Marshall, and $20,000 for Huff. Eisenhower, after being appointed Supreme Commander Allied Expeditionary Force, was also offered money by Quezon, but declined. These payments were known only to a few in Manila and Washington, including President Roosevelt and Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, until they were made public by historian Carol Petillo in 1979. The revelation tarnished MacArthur\'s reputation.Escape to Australia and Medal of Honor citation.In February 1942, as Japanese forces tightened their grip on the Philippines, MacArthur was ordered by President Roosevelt to relocate to Australia. MacArthur discussed the idea with his staff that he resign his commission and fight on as a private soldier in the Philippine resistance but Sutherland talked him out of it. On the night of March 12, 1942, MacArthur and a select group (that included his wife Jean and son Arthur, as well as Sutherland, Akin, Casey, Marshall, Willoughby, Diller, and George) left Corregidor in four PT boats. MacArthur, his family and Sutherland traveled in PT 41, commanded by Lieutenant John D. Bulkeley. The others followed in PT 34, PT 35 and PT 32. MacArthur and his party reached Del Monte Airfield in Bukidnon province on the island of Mindanao two days later. General George Marshall sent three U.S. Navy B-17s to pick them up. Two of them arrived, and brought the entire group to Australia.MacArthur arrived on March 17 at Batchelor Airfield, about south of Darwin, before flying to Alice Springs, where he took the Ghan through the Australian outback to Adelaide. His famous speech, in which he said, I came out of Bataan and I shall return, was first made at Terowie, a small railway township in South Australia on March 20. Upon his arrival in Adelaide, MacArthur abbreviated this to the now-famous, I came through and I shall return that made headlines. Washington asked MacArthur to amend his promise to, We shall return. He ignored the request. Bataan eventually surrendered on April 9, and Wainwright surrendered on Corregidor on May 6.For his leadership in the defense of the Philippines, General Marshall decided to award MacArthur the Medal of Honor, the decoration for which he had twice previously been nominated. It was admitted that MacArthur had not actually performed acts of valor in battle on Bataan but the 1927 award to Charles Lindbergh set a precedent. MacArthur chose to accept the medal on the basis that this award was intended not so much for me personally as it is a recognition of the indomitable courage of the gallant army which it was my honor to command. Arthur MacArthur, Jr. and Douglas MacArthur thus became the first father and son to be awarded the Medal of Honor. They remained the only pair until 2001 when Theodore Roosevelt was awarded posthumously for his service during the Spanish American War, Theodore Roosevelt, Jr. having received one posthumously for his service during World War II.General Headquarters.On April 18, 1942, MacArthur was appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA). Lieutenant General George Brett became Commander, Allied Air Forces, and Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary became Commander, Allied Naval Forces (though neither of these men were of MacArthur\'s choosing). Since the bulk of land forces in the theater were Australian, General Marshall insisted an Australian be appointed as Commander, Allied Land Forces, and the job went to General Sir Thomas Blamey. Although predominantly Australian and American, MacArthur\'s command also included small numbers of personnel from the Netherlands East Indies, the United Kingdom, and other countries. MacArthur established a close relationship with the Prime Minister of Australia, John Curtin, although many Australians resented MacArthur as a foreign general who had been imposed upon them.The staff of MacArthur\'s General Headquarters (GHQ) was built around the nucleus that had escaped from the Philippines with him, who became known as the Bataan Gang. Though Roosevelt and General Marshall pressed for Dutch and Australian officers to be assigned to GHQ, the heads of all the staff divisions were American and such officers of other nationalities as were assigned served under them. Initially located in Melbourne, the GHQ was moved to Brisbane in July because Brisbane was the northernmost city in Australia with the necessary communications facilities. GHQ occupied the AMP Insurance Society building. MacArthur\'s office and Willoughby\'s G-2 section were located on the 8th floor, while other staff sections occupied the four floors below.MacArthur formed his own signals intelligence organization, known as the Central Bureau, from Australian intelligence units and American cryptanalysts who had escaped from the Philippines; this unit forwarded Ultra information to Willoughby for analysis. After a press dispatch revealed details of the Japanese naval concentration at Rabaul during the Battle of the Coral Sea, President Roosevelt ordered that censorship be imposed in Australia. The Advisory War Council subsequently granted censorship authority to the GHQ over the Australian press. Australian newspapers were henceforth restricted to what was reported in the daily GHQ communiqu. Veteran correspondents considered them a total farce and characterized them as Alice-in-Wonderland information handed out at high level.Papuan Campaign.Anticipating that the Japanese would strike at Port Moresby again, the garrison was strengthened and MacArthur ordered the establishment of new bases at Merauke and Milne Bay to cover its flanks. The Battle of Midway in June 1942 led to plans to exploit this victory with a limited offensive in the Pacific. MacArthur\'s proposal for an attack on the main Japanese base at Rabaul met with objections from the U.S. Navy, which favored a less ambitious approach and objected to an Army general being in command of what would be an amphibious operation. The resulting compromise called for a three-stage advance, with the first, the seizure of the Tulagi area, being conducted by the Pacific Ocean Areas command, under Admiral Chester W. Nimitz. The later stages would be conducted under MacArthur\'s command as Supreme Allied Commander, South West Pacific Area.The Japanese struck first, landing at Buna in July, and at Milne Bay in August. The Australians soon defeated the Japanese at Milne Bay, but a series of defeats in the Kokoda Track campaign had a depressing effect back in Australia. On August 30, MacArthur radioed Washington that unless action was taken, the New Guinea Force would be overwhelmed. Having committed all the available Australian troops, MacArthur decided to send American troops. The 32nd Infantry Division, a poorly trained United States National Guard division, was selected to carry out a flanking maneuver. A series of embarrassing American reverses in the Battle of Buna-Gona led to outspoken criticism of the American troops by Blamey and other Australians. MacArthur sent Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger to take Buna, or not come back alive. MacArthur moved the advanced echelon of GHQ to Port Moresby on November 6, 1942. Buna finally fell on January 3, 1943. MacArthur awarded the Distinguished Service Cross to twelve officers for precise execution of operations. This use of the country\'s second highest award aroused some resentment, because while some, like Eichelberger and Major General George Alan Vasey, had fought in the field, others, like Sutherland and Willoughby, had not. For his part, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Medal, and the Australian government made him an honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath.MacArthur had little confidence in Brett\'s abilities as commander of Allied Air Forces SWPA, and in August 1942 selected Major General George C. Kenney to replace him. Kenney\'s application of air power in support of Blamey\'s ground forces would soon prove critical to Blamey\'s victory in the Battle of Wau. In September 1942, Vice Admiral Leary was replaced by Vice Admiral Arthur S. Carpender as commander of Allied Naval Forces SWPA. At that time, MacArthur\'s naval assets (commonly referred to as MacArthur\'s Navy) consisted of only 5 cruisers, 8 destroyers, 20 submarines and 7 small craft. This fleet became the Seventh Fleet on 15 March 1943, in advance of Operation Cartwheel.Operation Cartwheel.Lieutenant General Walter Krueger\'s Sixth Army headquarters arrived in SWPA in early 1943 but MacArthur had only three American divisions, and they were tired and depleted from the fighting at Buna and Guadalcanal. As a result, it became obvious that any military offensive in the South-West Pacific in 1943 would have to be carried out mainly by the Australian Army.In New Guinea, a country without roads, large-scale transportation of men and material would have to be accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. Disassembled landing craft were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the landing ships of Rear Admiral Daniel E. Barbey\'s VII Amphibious Force, which began arriving in late 1942. Barbey\'s force formed part of Carpender\'s newly formed Seventh Fleet. Carpender reported to MacArthur as Supreme Allied Commander, SWPA, but to Admiral Ernest King as Commander Seventh Fleet, which was part of King\'s United States Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations SWPA was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force. Although a few long-range P-38 Lightning fighters had arrived in SWPA in late 1942, further deliveries were suspended owing to the demands of Operation Torch.The main offensive began with the landing at Lae by Major General George Wootten\'s Australian 9th Division and the 2nd Engineer Special Brigade on September 4, 1943. The next day MacArthur watched the landing at Nadzab by paratroops of the 503rd Parachute Infantry from a B-17 circling overhead. The B-17 made the trip on three engines because one failed soon after leaving Port Moresby, but MacArthur insisted that it fly on to Nadzab. For this, MacArthur was awarded the Air Medal.Vasey\'s Australian 7th Division and Wooten\'s 9th Division converged on Lae, which fell on September 16. MacArthur advanced his timetable, and ordered the 7th Division to capture Kaiapit and Dumpu, while the 9th Division mounted an amphibious assault on Finschhafen. Here, the offensive bogged down. Part of the problem was that MacArthur had based his decision to assault Finschhafen on Willoughby\'s assessment that there were only 350 Japanese defenders at Finschhafen when there were actually nearly 5,000. A furious battle ensued.In early November, MacArthur\'s plan for a westward advance along the coast of New Guinea to the Philippines was incorporated into plans for the war against Japan approved at the Cairo Conference. Three months later, airmen reported no signs of enemy activity in the Admiralty Islands. Although his intelligence staff did not agree that the islands had been evacuated, MacArthur ordered an amphibious landing on Los Negros Island, marking the beginning of the Admiralty Islands campaign. MacArthur accompanied the assault force aboard, the flagship of Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid, who had recently replaced Carpender as commander of the Seventh Fleet. MacArthur, who came ashore with Kinkaid only seven hours after the first wave of landing craft, was awarded the Bronze Star for his actions in this campaign. After six weeks of fierce fighting, the 1st Cavalry Division captured the islands; the campaign officially ended on 18 May 1944.MacArthur now bypassed the Japanese forces at Hansa Bay and Wewak, and assaulted Hollandia and Aitape, which Willoughby reported to be lightly defended. Although they were out of range of the Fifth Air Force\'s fighters based in the Ramu Valley, the timing of the operation allowed the aircraft carriers of the Pacific Fleet to provide air support. Though risky, the operation turned out to be a brilliant success. MacArthur caught the Japanese off balance and cut off Lieutenant General Hataz Adachi\'s Japanese XVIII Army in the Wewak area. Because the Japanese were not expecting an attack, the garrison was weak, and Allied casualties were correspondingly light. However, the terrain turned out to be less suitable for airbase development than first thought, forcing MacArthur to seek better locations further west. Moreover, while bypassing Japanese forces had great tactical merit, it had the serious strategic drawback of tying up large numbers of Allied troops in order to contain them, and Adachi was far from beaten. In the Battle of Driniumor River, he would bring on the New Guinea campaign\'s bloodiest and most strategically useless battle.Leyte.In July 1944, President Roosevelt summoned MacArthur to meet with him in Hawaii to determine the phase of action against Japan. Nimitz and MacArthur agreed that the next step should be to advance on the southern and central Philippines. MacArthur emphasized the moral and political issues involved in a decision to liberate or bypass Luzon. He also spoke briefly of his plan to use the Australian Army to liberate Indonesia. Although the issue was not settled, both Roosevelt and Leahy were convinced of the soundness of MacArthur\'s plan. In September, Halsey\'s carriers made a series of air strikes on the Philippines. Opposition was feeble and Halsey concluded that Leyte was wide open and possibly undefended, and recommended that projected operations be skipped in favor of an assault on Leyte.Since Leyte was out of range of Kenney\'s land-based aircraft, MacArthur was entirely dependent on carrier aircraft for cover. Japanese air activity soon increased, with raids on Tacloban, where MacArthur decided to establish his headquarters, and on the fleet offshore. MacArthur enjoyed staying on Nashvilles bridge during air raids, although several bombs landed close by, and two nearby cruisers were hit. Over the next few days, the Imperial Japanese Navy staged a major counterattack in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. MacArthur attributed the near-disaster to command being divided between himself and Nimitz. Nor did the campaign ashore proceed smoothly. The timing of the assault so late in the year forced the combat troops, pilots, and the supporting logistical units to contend with heavy monsoonal rains that disrupted the airbase construction program. Adverse weather and valiant Japanese resistance slowed the American advance ashore. MacArthur was forced to ask Nimitz to recall the carriers to support the Sixth Army but they proved to be no substitute for land-based aircraft, and the lack of air cover permitted the Japanese Army to pour troops into Leyte. By the end of December, Krueger\'s headquarters estimated that 5,000 Japanese remained on Leyte, and on December 26 MacArthur issued a communiqu announcing that the campaign can now be regarded as closed except for minor mopping up. Yet Eichelberger\'s Eighth Army would kill more than 27,000 Japanese on Leyte between then and the end of the campaign in May 1945. On December 18, 1944, MacArthur was promoted to the new five-star rank of General of the Army  one day before Nimitz was promoted to Fleet Admiral, also a five-star rank. MacArthur had a Filipino silversmith make the rank badges from American, Australian, Dutch and Filipino coins.Luzon.MacArthur\'s next move was the invasion of Mindoro, where there were good potential airfield sites around the San Jose area. Willoughby estimated, correctly as it turned out, that the island had only about 1,000 Japanese defenders. The problem this time was getting there. A parachute drop was considered, but the airfields on Leyte lacked the space to hold the required transport aircraft. Kinkaid balked at sending escort carriers into the restricted waters of the Sulu Sea, and Kenney could not guarantee land based air cover. The operation was clearly hazardous, and MacArthur\'s staff talked him out of accompanying the invasion on the Nashville. As the invasion force entered the Sulu Sea, a kamikaze struck Nashville, killing 133 people and wounding 190 more, including the task force commander, Brigadier General William C. Dunkel. The landings were made unopposed on December 15, 1944, and within two weeks Australian and American engineers had three airstrips in operation, but not since Anzio had the navy experienced so much difficulty supporting an amphibious operation after the initial landing. The resupply convoys were repeatedly attacked by kamikaze aircraft and on December 2627 a Japanese naval force attacked the area, sinking a destroyer and damaging other ships.The way was now clear for the invasion of Luzon. This time, based on different interpretations of the same intelligence data, Willoughby\'s G-2 Section at GHQ estimated the strength of General Tomoyuki Yamashita\'s forces on Luzon at 137,000, while that of Sixth Army estimated it at 234,000. The Sixth Army Brigadier General Clyde D. Eddleman attempted to lay out the reasons for the Sixth Army\'s assessment, but MacArthur\'s response was Bunk!. He felt that even Willoughby\'s estimate was too high. Audacity, calculated risk, and a clear strategic aim were MacArthur\'s attributes, and he was prepared to disregard the intelligence estimates. However, all the estimates were too low: Yamashita had more than 287,000 troops on Luzon. This time MacArthur traveled on the, watching as the ship was near-missed by a bomb and torpedoes fired by midget submarines. The GHQ communiqu read: The decisive battle for the liberation of the Philippines and the control of the Southwest pacific is at hand. General MacArthur is in personal command at the front and landed with his assault troops.MacArthur\'s primary concern was the capture of the port of Manila and the airbase at Clark Field, which were required to support future operations. He urged his front line commanders on. On January 25, 1945 he moved his advanced headquarters forward to Hacienda Luisita, closer to the front than Krueger\'s at Calasiao. On January 30, MacArthur ordered the 1st Cavalry Division\'s commander, Major General Verne D. Mudge, to conduct a rapid advance on Manila. On February 3, it reached the northern outskirts of Manila and the campus of the University of Santo Tomas where 3,700 internees were liberated. Unknown to the Americans, Rear Admiral Sanji Iwabuchi had decided to defend Manila to the death. The Battle of Manila raged for the next three weeks. In order to spare the civilian population, MacArthur prohibited the use of air strikes, but thousands of civilians died in the crossfire or Japanese massacres. He also refused to restrict the traffic of civilians who clogged the roads in and out of Manila, placing humanitarian concerns above military ones except for emergencies. Most of MacArthur\'s 8,000-volume military library, which included books inherited from his father, was lost. Nonetheless, he continued his habit of reading military history and biography until his death. For his part in the capture of Manila, MacArthur was awarded his third Distinguished Service Cross.Southern Philippines.Although MacArthur had no specific directive from the Joint Chiefs to do so, and the fighting on Luzon was far from over, he committed the Eighth Army, Seventh Fleet and Thirteenth Air Force to a series of operations to liberate the remainder of the Philippines from the Japanese. A series of 52 amphibious landings were made in the central and southern Philippines between February and July 1945. In the GHQ communiqu on July 5, MacArthur announced that the Philippines had now been liberated and all operations ended, although Yamashita still held out in northern Luzon. Starting in May 1945, MacArthur used his Australian troops in the invasion of Borneo. MacArthur accompanied the assault on Labuan on USS Boise, and visited the troops ashore, along with Lieutenant General Sir Leslie Morshead and Air Vice Marshal William Bostock. En route back to his headquarters in Manila, he visited Davao, where he told Eichelberger that no more than 4,000 Japanese remained alive on Mindanao. A few months later, six times that number would surrender. In July 1945, he set out on Boise once more to be with the Australian 7th Division for the landing at Balikpapan. MacArthur was awarded his fourth Distinguished Service Medal.In April 1945, MacArthur became commander in chief U.S. Army Forces Pacific (AFPAC), in charge of all Army and Army Air Force units in the Pacific, except the Twentieth Air Force. At the same time, Nimitz became commander of all naval forces. Command in the Pacific therefore remained divided. GHQ became AFPAC headquarters in addition to SWPA. MacArthur created two new commands, AFMIDPAC under Lieutenant General Robert C. Richardson, Jr., and AFWESPAC under Lieutenant General Wilhelm D. Styer, which absorbed USASOS and USAFFE. This reorganization, which took some months to actually accomplish, was part of preparations for Operation Downfall, the invasion of Japan. The first phase, the invasion of Kyushu, known as Operation Olympic, was scheduled to commence on November 1, 1945. The invasion was pre-empted by the surrender of Japan in August 1945. On September 2, MacArthur accepted the formal Japanese surrender aboard, thus ending hostilities in World War II. In recognition of his role as a maritime strategist, the U.S. Navy awarded him the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.'),(30546607,'Gabriel_Bergen','Gabriel Bergen.Gabriel Bergen (born 6 July 1982 in Dawson Creek) is a Canadian rower.

Although secretly jealous and embittered by the fact that her fat friend is now engaged, Regan notifies their two other friends, the sardonic cocaine addict Gena (Lizzy Caplan) and the rowdy party girl Katie (Isla Fisher).Six months later, the women are preparing for Becky\'s impromptu bachelorette party that evening; Gena flies in to New York from Los Angeles, and the four meet at the hotel, where Katie announces that Gena has brought cocaine for all of them to do. At the dinner party that night, Gena runs into her ex-boyfriend Clyde (Adam Scott), whom she sees flirting with Dale\'s younger sister, and Katie runs into Joe (Kyle Bornheimer), a former classmate and pot dealer. Trevor (James Marsden), the best man, gives a speech at the party, and Gena, high on cocaine, reveals in her toast that she once caught Becky forcing herself to throw up in the high school bathrooms.After the dinner, the women go to their suite, where Katie\'s gay co-worker arrives and does a striptease for the women, but Becky stops it after he jokingly calls her Pigface, a cruel nickname of hers in high school.

Drunk and high, the three accidentally rip the dress, and Katie gets a nosebleed and stains it with her blood.Regan contacts a friend who owns a bridal store, who reluctantly agrees to open the store for them in the middle of the night.

Trevor text messages Regan asking the girls to stop by the strip club the men are at, which they agree to. Gena takes the dress into the strip club\'s bathroom where she attempts to clean it; there, she has a conversation with a stripper who begins using the dress as a towel and toilet paper.

The film ends as the four women make up and dance together at the party.Reception.The film has received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 56% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 96 reviews with the consensus, stating, It has its moments, but Bachelorette ultimately plays it too safe with its trio of unlikeable leads, betraying them with a predictably sentimental final act that undermines the bracingly honest humor preceding it.Reelview\'s James Berardinelli gave the film his lowest rating of zero stars, stating, Sometimes a movie is so bad it makes me want to go into seclusion and never see another film. Bachelorette is one of those. His summary labeled the film the movie to beat in the 2012 Worst Film of the Year competition.Stephen Holden of The New York Times, however, gave the film a rave review, stating, Bachelorette is more tartly written, better acted and less forgiving than male-centric equivalents, like The Hangover movies... it comes at you with the crackling intensity of machine-gun fire.On the VOD platform, the film reached #1 on iTunes.Home media.Bachelorette was released on DVD and Blu-ray on March 19, 2013.'),(30087943,'Retizhe_Cove','Retizhe Cove.Retizhe Cove (, Zaliv Retizhe \\\'za-liv re-ti-\'zhe\\) is the 5.8 km wide cove indenting for 6.2 km the south coast of Trinity Peninsula in Graham Land, Antarctica.

The song was released by Fantasy Records as a single from the band\'s second studio album, Bayou Country, which was released by the same record company in January 1969. The single is generally considered to have been released in early January 1969 although at least one source states that it came out just before Christmas 1968. The song became a major hit in the United States, peaking at #2 on the Billboard Hot 100 in March 1969, the first of five non-consecutive singles to peak at #2 for the group.Background and recording.In a 1969 interview, Fogerty said that he wrote it in the two days after he was discharged from the National Guard. In the liner notes for the 2008 expanded reissue of Bayou Country, Joel Selvin explained that the songs for the album started when John Fogerty was in the National Guard, that the riffs for Proud Mary, Born on the Bayou, and Keep on Chooglin\' were conceived by Fogerty at a concert in the Avalon Ballroom, and Proud Mary was arranged from parts of different songs, one of which was about a washerwoman named Mary. The line Left a good job in the city was written following Fogerty\'s discharge from the National Guard, and the line rollin\' on the river was from a movie by Will Rogers.In the Macintosh program Garage Band, Fogerty explained that he liked Beethoven\'s Fifth Symphony, and wanted to open a song with a similar intro, inferring the way Proud Mary opens with the repeated C chord to A chord. The basic track for Proud Mary, as with the other songs on the album, was recorded by John Fogerty (lead guitar), Tom Fogerty (rhythm guitar), Stu Cook (bass), and Doug Clifford (drums) at RCA Studios in Hollywood, California, with John overdubbing instruments and all the vocals later.Solomon Burke version.In 1969 Burke had a small hit with his cover of the song, which was his second release for Bell and was co-produced by singer Tamiko Jones, who was being rehabilitated after a bout of polio, and was at the time Burke\'s fiance and manager. Burke recalls: We went to Muscle Shoals and recorded Proud Mary, which they didnt like at all. They thought it was stupid to record a song Proud Mary, which was already on the charts. I was explaining to them that it was a very big record, but its a very white record, a pop record. We will redo the record, open up the doors for it to get on the r&b charts and make the black stations to play the record... It was a Solomon Burke record made in Muscle Shoals. We proved that we can make a hit record without Jerry Wexler eating sandwiches with us. This record was a hit without anybodys help. Proud Mary was only promoted by Tamiko Jones and myself. According to Mark Denning, While that may have seemed like a bald-faced bid for pop radio play, in Burke\'s hands the song became a bracing tale of life in the Deep South as African-Americans searched for liberation aboard the ship that carried them as slaves and put them to undignified labor serving wealthy whites.John Fogerty, the song\'s composer, was impressed by Burke\'s version of his song: Two thousand miles away this man had crawled right up inside my head to learn what Proud Mary was all about. Sure, it\'s great when someone sings your song, but when he understands it, you listen like it was the first time. Reworked as a celebration of black consciousness, his potent mix of gospel and country  the kind that defined his earlier sides for Atlantic  and driven by a Southern funk-like strut... it returned Burke to the US R&B Top 20, with the single reaching #15 on the R&B charts and #45 on the pop charts. According to Burke in a 2002 interview: I was in Vegas for sixteen weeks at the Sands Hotel. I missed this record being a hit, because we werent there to promote the record, we had no backing. The greatest thing I ever did was tell Ike Turner, Hey man, you should get on this record I think you and Tina could tear this thing up. On 24 May 1969 Burke sang his version of Proud Mary on American Bandstand.Tina Turner versions.Ike & Tina Turner first covered Proud Mary in 1970. This version was released as a single from their Workin\' Together album and the song differed greatly from the structure of the original, but is also well known and has become one of Tina Turner\'s most recognizable signature songs. The Turners\' version was substantially rearranged by Soko Richardson and Ike Turner. The song started off with a slow, sultry soulful tone in which Tina introduced the song and warned the audience that she and the band were gonna start it off nice and easy as we never do nothing nice and easy but said they would finish it nice and rough. After the lyrics are first sung softly by the Turners, the song is then turned into a funk rock vamp with Tina and the Ikettes delivering gospel-influenced vocals. It reached #4 on the pop charts on March 27, 1971, two years to the week after Creedence Clearwater Revival\'s version was at its peak, and won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Vocal Performance by a Group in 1972.In the Tina Turner biopic, What\'s Love Got to Do with It, the song is performed in a timeline of events in Ike and Tina\'s career in which the couple are transformed from an opening act to The Rolling Stones to a major headlining act by the mid-1970s. However, the film took significant liberties with that timeline; for instance, the film has the group performing the song in 1968 when they reportedly opened for The Stones in the UK, but the Turners didn\'t open for them until 1969 and Proud Mary had not yet been released by Creedence Clearwater Revival.Following the original version\'s release and its success, Ike and Tina included the song in their live act and first performed a version of the song on The Ed Sullivan Show. It was also performed in 1971 (the year of the Turners\' version\'s release), on April 22, 1972 on Soul Train, and 1974.In 1988, a live solo version was included on the album Tina Live in Europe. Tina Turner later re-recorded the song in the studio for the biopic\'s 1993 soundtrack album of the same name. This version was released as a promotional single issued to radio stations and DJs. Tina\'s solo version was later included on her 2004 greatest hits album All the Best. After a contestant\'s performance of the song on The X Factor in 2010, this version entered the UK Singles Chart at #62 and fell to #121 the next week, it also entered the Scottish Singles Chart at #40.Another live version was released in 2009 on the Tina Live album. It was recorded on March 21, 2009 in Arnhem, Netherlands as part of Turner\'s 50th Anniversary Tour.

On Saturday, May 3, 2014, Springsteen performed the song and Green River with John Fogerty during Springsteen\'s set at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival.Elvis Presley also often performed the song in his Las Vegas shows and on tour in the early 1970s. Versions can be found on the albums On Stage (1970), \' (1972) and An Afternoon in the Garden (1972).

As a child he played the role of Love at a festival given at the Hermitage at Versailles by his father and mother in honour of Marie-Antoinette. Aged 6, Amde Despans-Cubires was briefly imprisoned with his family in the prison des Rcollets of Versailles after the day of 10 August 1792, before he was made one of the enfants de la libert raised by the state at the former abbey of Saint-Martin, before being welcomed into the Jordan family. In 1803, at the request of his mother Madame de Bonneuil, he was adopted by his father and took his name.First Empire.Placed in the prytane at Saint-Cyr, he entered the army as a private in the 1st Cuirassier Regiment in 1803 and entering the military school at Fontainebleau on 23 October 1804, leaving it as a sous-lieutenant in the 15th Regiment of the Line. He served in that regiment in the Austerlitz, Prussian and Polish campaigns, being mentioned in despatches at Austerlitz and wounded at Jena (1806). Promoted to lieutenant on 30 November 1806 he received the cross of the Lgion d\'honneur at Eylau (1807).Aide-de-camp to general Morand (from 12 January 1808), he followed him in the Austrian campaign of 1809, the French invasion of Russia in 1812 and the 1813 German campaign. He fought with distinction at Eckmhl and rose to captain at Essling (7 June 1809). He assisted at the battle of Wagram (6 July 1809) and had three horses shot from under him at the battle of Borodino. Napoleon I of France made him an officer of the Lgion dhonneur in reward for his good conduct in the 1813 campaign, in which he had become chef de bataillon (promoted 3 October 1813). On 19 November 1813, he was made colonel of the 18th Light Infantry Regiment. Also in 1813 he married the novelist Agla Buffaut, daughter of his own half-sister Marie-Michelle Guesnon de Bonneuil, at first vicomtesse du Bouzet de Marin then Madame Philippe Buffaut.On Napoleon\'s return from Elba in 1815, colonel de Cubires was made colonel  la suite to the 1st Light Infantry Regiment, of which the titular colonel was Beurnonville. According to Jolyet, Napoleon reviewed this regiment on the day after his arrival back in Paris on 21 March and asked who was its commander. Cubires replied Sir, it is colonel de Beurnonville; but he is ill. Napoleon replied Beurnonville is not sick - it is you, colonel Cubires, who shall nevertheless take command of the 1st Light Infantry. Cubires wished to decline, but Napoleon did not give him time to do so. Although devoted to Napoleon, Cubires demanded his soldiers to come out against the Acte additionnel aux constitutions de lEmpire, to mark the need for a liberal and reforming government. The 1st Light Infantry was thus the only regiment to vote against it. In 1815, Despans-Cubires fought with his regiment at Waterloo and was wounded at Quatre-Bras and at Mont-Saint-Jean.Bourbon Restoration.According to Jolyet, Cubires was the most valiant soldier and the best man-of-war that I have known. With this [he brought] a remarkable beauty, a brilliant spirit, [and] a generous and independent love. One of the army\'s staff writing reports for the army dismissals after the Hundred Days stated that he had an agreeable physique, [was] very instructive, an excellent colonel, [who] served with zeal and loyalty, excellent conduct and decided that he was to be kept on in the Bourbon army. Despite that praise he lost his commission after the Hundred Days, but his father\'s influence at court allowed him to obtain the general receipt of the Meuse dpartement and the cross of the Order of Saint Louis (1820). He returned to the army for the Spanish Civil War of 1823, and was put at the head of the 27th Regiment of Line Infantry.

Returning to France in 1837 with the rank of lieutenant-general, he next became Minister for War in the 1839 transitional government (31 March-13 May 1839) then in Adolphe Thiers\'s second cabinet (1 March-29 October 1840). He attached his name to Paris\'s fortifications, to the decision to write a history of all France\'s regiments since Francis I and to the organisation of the chasseurs of Vincennes. Made a peer of France on 7 November 1839, he took part in the discussions of the Chambre des pairs on taxes and roads before being raised to grand officer of the Lgion dhonneur on 27 April 1840.The Teste-Cubires scandal.After leaving the army, general Despans-Cubires was compromised in the Teste-Cubires affair, one of the worst scandals of the July Monarchy. Despans-Cubires had bought 159000 shares (7% of the capital) in a business which, under the concession de Gouhenans, had won authorisation to exploit the coal deposits in Gouhenans and the surrounding area. In searching for coal seams, the business had discovered a seam of rock salt and it demanded that it be given the concession to mine this, but was refused. Despite this, the business started extracting and selling the salt. One of its associates, Parmentier, was imprisoned and fined 500 francs and the salt mine was closed on 5 February 1835.On 24 April 1841, the business again demanded the salt concession. General Despans-Cubires proposed to buy the authorisation demanded from the minister for public works, Jean-Baptiste Teste, and in an 1842 letter to his associates indicated There is no hesitation on the means by which we should create a supporter within the council [of ministers]. I have the means of arriving at this supporter, and it is up to you to provide the means of interesting him [...] Do not forget that the government is in the hands of greedy and corrupt men. Teste accepted a bribe of 94,000 francs from the company. In the meantime, the 1844 novel The Count of Monte Cristo was published - according to Librairie Gnrale Franaise (1995), its character of Fernand Mondego was inspired by general Despans-Cubires.The affair came to light in May 1847 during the trial of the associates of the mining company before the Seine civil tribunal. The company director, Parmentier, submitted in his defence several pieces of correspondence from general Despans-Cubires evoking bribery. The affair received massive publicity and the scandal echoed throughout government. The king decided to move the case to be tried before the Chambre des pairs. On 8 July 1847, Teste, Despans-Cubires, Parmentier and a certain Pellapra (former receiver-general who had served as intermediary) were brought before the high court on corruption charges and on 17 July general Despans-Cubires was condemned to civic degradation and a fine of 10,000 francs.

He was mentioned as one of the 16th-century artists of the stained glass window cartoons in an exhibition of the Janskerk in Gouda in 1938, but his name was probably confused with Dirk Jansz Verheije (d. 1603) of Delft, a painter from Delft who made the window-gift from Delft for the Janskerk in the 16th century.

He won a gold medal in the marathon at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. He has also represented Australia at the IAAF World Cross Country Championships and the IAAF World Half Marathon Championships. On the road, he has won at the Gold Coast Half Marathon and the City2Surf race in Sydney.Career.Born in Southport, Queensland, Shelley made his first international appearance at the 2002 World Junior Championships in Athletics. He had set a career best of 9:08.28 for the 3000 metres steeplechase earlier that year but did not manage to progress beyond the heats at the competition. He soon changed his focus to the 1500 metres instead and set a personal best of 3:39.90 before going on to take third at the 2003 Australian Athletics Championships. He also ran in the short race at the 2004 IAAF World Cross Country Championships.He emerged in the senior ranks in 2007, finishing in 65th place at the 2007 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and running a 3000 metres best time of 7:59.59. He began moving into longer distance events in 2008 and, after placing 50th over at the 2008 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, he won the half marathon event at the Gold Coast Marathon in July, recording a time of 1:02:41. He earned selection for the 2008 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships and he was the region\'s best performer with a sixteenth-place finish. At the end of the year he competed in the 10,000 metres at the Zatopek Classic in Melbourne and finished in third place with a time of 28:08.96.He broke new ground with personal bests of 13:38.30 for the 5000 metres and 27:59.77 for the 10,000 metres at the start of 2009. His third appearance at the World Cross Country Championships resulted in his best performance to date, coming in 36th place in the senior race. He returned to the Gold Coast half marathon to defend his title but he was pipped at the line by Tanzanian Dickson Marwa, leaving Shelley with a personal best of 1:02:10 and the runner-up spot just one second behind. In September he won the City2Surf in Sydney with a time of 41:02. However, the 2009 season also brought along some setbacks for Shelley\'s career. He suffered a stress fracture in his leg and he also lost his funding from the Australian Institute of Sport.Making his debut in the event, Shelley entered the 2010 Rotterdam Marathon in April and finished in twelfth place with a time of 2:13:05. He represented Australia at the 2010 Commonwealth Games and was chosen for the marathon. Running in only his second outing over the distance, the relatively slow pace worked in his favour as he overhauled Amos Tirop Matui in the final stages to take the silver medal behind John Kelai.He was invited to run at the 2011 London Marathon and he reached the top ten, setting a personal best of 2:11:38 hours. His second marathon race of the year came at the Amsterdam Marathon in October. Although he finished eleventh overall, he set a personal best time of 2:11:23 hours.Running in bib number 1059, Shelley placed 16th overall in a time of 2:14:10 at the 2012 London Olympics.

This document was prepared by the Group of Specialists on Coastal Protection and should be used \'as a source of inspiration for national legislation and practice\' by decision makers.The Group of Specialists set up in 1995, pursuant to adecision by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, who met for the first time on 6 and 7 June 1996. It noted that a great deal of technical and scientific research had been carried out in the field of coastal protection and that various principles and legal texts had been drawn up. It also noted that all of the work undertaken highlighted the need for integrated management and planning of coastal areas, but that, despite all the efforts already made, the situation of coastal areas continued to deteriorate. The Group had acknowledged that this was due to difficulties in implementing the concept of integrated management, and that it was becoming necessary to provide instruments which would make it easier to apply the principles of integrated coastal management and planning, which had to be pursued to ensure sustainable management of coastal areas. The Group therefore proposed that the Council of Europe, in close co-operation with the Coastal & Marine Union (EUCC) and United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The final version of the Code as well of the a MODEL LAW to be used as a guide for modefying local and national legislation, can be free downloaded from the web.Ancient harbour works are still visible in a few of the harbours that exist today, while others have recently been explored by underwater archaeologists. Most of the grander ancient harbor works have disappeared following the fall of the Western Roman Empire.Most coastal efforts were directed to port structures, with the exception of a few places where life depended on coastline protection. Venice and its lagoon is one such case. Protection of the shore in Italy, England and the Netherlands can be traced back at least to the 6th century.The ancients understood such phenomena as the Mediterranean currents and wind patterns and the wind-wave cause-effect link.The Romans introduced many revolutionary innovations in harbor design. They learned to build walls underwater and managed to construct solid breakwaters to protect fully exposed harbors. In some cases wave reflection may have been used to prevent silting. They also used low, water-surface breakwaters to trip the waves before they reached the main breakwater.They became the first dredgers in the Netherlands to maintain the harbour at Velsen. Silting problems here were solved when the previously sealed solid piers were replaced with new open-piled jetties.The threat of attack from the sea caused many coastal towns and their harbours to be abandoned. Other harbours were lost due to natural causes such as rapid silting, shoreline advance or retreat, etc. The Venetian Lagoon was one of the few populated coastal areas with continuous prosperity and development where written reports document the evolution of coastal protection works.Engineering and scientific skills remained alive in the east, in Byzantium, where the Eastern Roman Empire survived for six hundred years while Western Rome decayed.Although great strides were made in the general scientific arena, little improvement was done beyond the Roman approach to harbour construction after the Renaissance.In the early 19th century, the advent of the steam engine, the search for new lands and trade routes, the expansion of the British Empire through her colonies, and other influences, all contributed to the revitalization of sea trade and a renewed interest in port works.Evolution of shore protection and the shift from structures to beach nourishment.Prior to the 1950s, the general practice was to use hard structures to protect against beach erosion or storm damages. These structures were usually coastal armoring such as seawalls and revetments or sand-trapping structures such as groynes. During the 1920s and \'30s, private or local community interests protected many areas of the shore using these techniques in a rather ad hoc manner. In certain resort areas, structures had proliferated to such an extent that the protection actually impeded the recreational use of the beaches. Erosion of the sand continued, but the fixed back-beach line remained, resulting in a loss of beach area.The obtrusiveness and cost of these structures led in the late 1940s and early 1950s, to move toward a new, more dynamic, method. Projects no longer relied solely on hard coastal defence structures, as techniques were developed which replicated the protective characteristics of natural beach and dune systems. The resultant use of artificial beaches and stabilized dunes as an engineering approach was an economically viable and more environmentally friendly means for dissipating wave energy and protecting coastal developments.Over the past hundred years the limited knowledge of coastal sediment transport processes at the local authorities level has often resulted in inappropriate measures of coastal erosion mitigation. In many cases, measures may have solved coastal erosion locally but have exacerbated coastal erosion problems at other locations -up to tens of kilometers away- or have generated other environmental problems.Current challenges in coastal management.The coastal zone is a region where interaction of the sea and land processes occurs. They occupy less than 15% of the Earth\'s land surface; yet accommodate more than 40% of the world population. Nearly 1.2 billion people live within 100km of a shoreline and 100 m of sea level with an average density nearly 3 times higher than the global average for population. With three-quarters of the world population expected to reside in the coastal zone by 2025, human activities originating from this small land area will impose an inordinate amount of pressures on the global system. Coastal zones contain rich resources to produce goods and services and are home to most commercial and industrial activities.In the European Union, almost half of the population now lives within 50 kilometres of the sea and coastal zone resources produce much of the Union\'s economic wealth. The fishing, shipping and tourism industries all compete for vital space along Europe\'s estimated 89 000 kilometres of coastline, and coastal zones contain some of Europe\'s most fragile and valuable natural habitats. Shore protection consists up to the 50\'s of interposing a static structure between the sea and the land to prevent erosion and or flooding, and it has a long history. From that period new technical or friendly policies have been developed to preserve the environment when possible.It is already important where there are extensive low-lying areas that require protection. For instance: Venice, New Orleans, Nagara river in Japan, the Netherlands, Caspian Sea.Protection against sea level rise in the 21st century will be especially important, as sea level rise is currently accelerating. This will be a challenge to coastal management, since seawalls and breakwaters are generally expensive to construct, and the costs to build protection in the face of sea-level rise would be enormous.Changes in sea level have a direct adaptative response from beaches and coastal systems, as we can see in the succession of a lowering sea level. When the sea level rises, coastal sediments are in part pushed up by wave and tide energy, so sea-level rise processes have a component of sediment transport landwards. This results in a dynamic model of rise effects with a continuous sediment displacement that is not compatible with static models where coastline change is only based on topographic data.Planning approaches.The decision to choose a strategy is site-specific, depending on pattern of relative sea-level change, geomorphological setting, sediment availability and erosion, as well a series of social, economic and political factors.Alternatively, integrated coastal zone management approaches may be used to prevent development in erosion- or flood-prone areas to begin with. Growth management can be a challenge for coastal local authorities who often struggle to provide the infrastructure required by new residents seeking seachange lifestyles. Sustainable transport investment to reduce the average footprint of coastal visitors is often a good way out of coastal gridlock. Examples include Dongtan and the Gold Coast Oceanway.The \'Managed Retreat\' option, involving no protection, is cheap and expedient. The coast takes care of itself and coastal facilities are abandoned to coastal erosion, with either gradual landward retreat or evacuation and resettlement elsewhere. This is the usual response when land of little value will be lost. The only pollution produced is from the resettlement process. Where endangered property has high value, it is less often applied.Managed retreat.Managed retreat is an alternative to constructing or maintaining coastal structures. Managed retreat allows an area to become flooded. This process is usually in low lying estuarine or deltaic areas and floods land that has at some point in the past been reclaimed from the sea. Managed retreat is often a response to a change in sediment budget or to sea level rise. The technique is used when the land adjacent to the sea is low in value. A decision is made to allow the land to erode and flood, creating new shoreline habitats. This process may continue over many years and natural stabilization will occur.The earliest managed retreat in the UK was an area of 0.8 ha at Northey Island in starfish island flooded in 1991. This was followed by Tollesbury and Orplands in Essex, where the sea walls were breached in 1995.In the Ebro delta (Spain) coastal authorities have planned a managed retreat in response to coastal erosion (MMA 2005, Sitges, Meeting on Coastal Engineering;).Cost  The main cost is generally the purchase of land to be flooded. Compensation for relocation of residents may be needed. Any other human made structure which will be engulfed by the sea may need to be safely dismantled to prevent sea pollution.In some cases, a retaining wall or bund must be constructed inland in order to protect land beyond the area to be flooded, although such structures can generally be lower than would be needed on the existing coast. Monitoring of the evolution of the flooded area is another cost. Costs may be lowest if existing defenses are left to fail naturally, but often the realignment project will be more actively managed, for example by creating an artificial breach in existing defences to allow the sea in at a particular place in a controlled fashion, or by pre-forming drainage channels for created salt-marsh.Hold the line.Human strategies on the coast have been heavily based on a static engineered response, whereas the coast is in, or strives towards, a dynamic equilibrium (Schembri, 2009). Solid coastal structures are built and persist because they protect expensive properties or infrastructures, but they often relocate the problem downdrift or to another part of the coast. Soft options like beach nourishment, while also being temporary and needing regular replenishment, appear more acceptable, and go some way to restore the natural dynamism of the shoreline. However, in many cases there is a legacy of decisions that were made in the past which have given rise to the present threats to coastal infrastructure and which necessitate immediate shore protection. For instance, the seawall and promenade of many coastal cities in Europe represents a highly engineered use of prime seafront space, which might be preferably designated as public open space, parkland and amenities if it were available today. Such open space might also allow greater flexibility in terms of future land-use change, for instance through managed retreat, in the face of threats of erosion or inundation as a result of sea-level rise. Foredunes areas represent a natural reserve which can be called upon in the face of extreme events; building on these areas leaves little option but to undertake costly protective measures when extreme events (whether amplified by gradual global change or not) threaten. Managed retreat can comprise \'setbacks\', rolling easements and other planning tools including building within a particular design life. Maintenance of those structures or soft techniques can arrive at a critical point (economically or environmental) to change adopted strategy.Move seaward.The futility of trying to predict future scenarios where there is a large human influence is apparent. Even future climate is to a certain extent a function of what humans choose to make of it, for example by restricting greenhouse gas emissions to control climate change. In some cases - where new areas are needed for new economic or ecological development - a move seaward strategy can be adopted. Examples from erosion include: Koge Bay (Dk) Western Scheldt estuary (NI), Chatelaillon (F), Ebro delta (E)There is an obvious downside to this strategy. Coastal erosion is already widespread, and there are many coasts where exceptional high tides or storm surges result in encroachment on the shore, impinging on human activity. If the sea rises, many coasts that are developed with infrastructure along or close to the shoreline will be unable to accommodate erosion. They will experience a so-called coastal squeeze whereby the ecological or geomorphological zones that would normally retreat landwards encounter solid structures and are squeezed out. Wetlands, salt marshes, mangroves and adjacent fresh water wetlands are particularly likely to suffer from this squeeze.An upside to the strategy is that moving seaward (and upward) can create land of high value which can bring the investment required to cope with climate change.Limited intervention.Limited intervention is an action taken whereby the management only solves the problem to some extent, usually in areas of low economic significance. Measures taken using limited intervention often encourage the succession of haloseres, including salt marshes and sand dunes. This will normally result in the land behind the halosere being more sufficiently protected, as wave energy will be dissipated by the accumulated sediment and additional vegetation residing in the newly formed habitat. Although the new halosere is not strictly man-made, as many natural processes will contribute to the succession of the halosere, anthropogenic factors are partially responsible for the formation as an initial factor was needed to help start the process of succession. This must not be confused with \'accommodate\' which is about property for example effective insurance, early warning systems and not about habitat.Construction techniques.The following is a catalogue of relevant techniques that could be employed as coastal management techniques. The costs given are very rough estimates made during 2005, based on UK Pound sterling.Groynes.Groynes are barriers or walls perpendicular to the sea, often made of greenharts, concrete, rock or wood. Beach material builds up on the downdrift side, where littoral drift is predominantly in one direction, creating a wider and a more plentiful beach, therefore enhancing the protection for the coast because the sand material filters and absorbs the wave energy. However, there is a corresponding loss of beach material on the updrift side, requiring that another groyne to be built there. Moreover, groynes do not protect the beach against storm-driven waves and if placed too close together will create currents, which will carry sand material offshore.Groynes are extremely cost-effective coastal defence measures, requiring little maintenance, and are one of the most common coastal defence structures. However, groynes are increasingly viewed as detrimental to the aesthetics of the coastline, and face strong opposition in many coastal communities.Many experts consider groynes to be a soft solution to coastal erosion because of the enhancement of the existing beach.But groyne construction creates a problem known as terminal groyne syndrome. The terminal groyne prevents longshore drift from bringing material to other nearby places. This is a common problem along the Hampshire and Sussex coastline in the UK; an example is Worthing. Beach material does not get washed away because of these groynes but can cause damage to other parts of the coast.Sea walls.Walls of concrete or rock, built at the base of a cliff or at the back of a beach, are used to protect a settlement against erosion or flooding. They are usually about high. Older-style vertical seawalls reflected all the energy of the waves back out to sea, and for this purpose were often given recurved crest walls which also increase the local turbulence, and thus increasing entrainment of sand and sediment. During storms, sea walls help longshore drift.Modern seawalls aim to re-direct most of the incident energy, resulting in low reflected waves and much reduced turbulence and thus take the form of sloping revetments. Current designs use porous designs of rock, concrete armour (Seabees, SHEDs, Xblocs) with intermediate flights of steps for beach access, whilst in places where high rates of pedestrian access are required, the steps take over the whole of the frontage, but at a flatter slope if the same crest levels are to be achieved.Care needs to be taken in the location of a seawall, particularly in relation to the swept prism of the beach profile, the consequences of long-term beach recession and amenity crest level. These factors must be considered in assessing the cost-benefit ratio, which must be favorable in order to justify construction of a seawall.Sea walls can cause beaches to dissipate, rendering them useless for beach goers. Their presence also scars the very landscape that they are trying to save.Modern examples can be found at Cronulla (NSW, 1985-6), Blackpool (19862001), Lincolnshire (19921997) and Wallasey (19831993).The sites at Blackpool and Cronulla can be visited both by Google Earth and by local webcams (Cronulla, Cleveleys).An example is the seawall at Sandwich, Kent, where the Seabee seawall is buried at the back of the beach under the shingle with crest level at road kerb level.Sea walls are probably the second most traditional method used in coastal management.Sea walls cost 10,000 per metre (depending on material, height and width), 10,000,000 per km (depending on material, height and width).Revetments.Wooden slanted or upright blockades, built parallel to the sea on the coast, usually towards the back of the beach to protect the cliff or settlement beyond. The most basic revetments consist of timber slants with a possible rock infill. Waves break against the revetments, which dissipate and absorb the energy. The cliff base is protected by the beach material held behind the barriers, as the revetments trap some of the material. They may be watertight, covering the slope completely, or porous, to allow water to filter through after the wave energy has been dissipated. Most revetments do not significantly interfere with transport of longshore drift. Since the wall greatly absorbs the energy instead of reflecting, it erodes and destroys the revetment structure; therefore, major maintenance will be needed within a moderate time of being built, this will be greatly determined by the material the structure was built with and the quality of the product.The Cost  Confirmed by material used; est. $2340$4000. Average $10 per meter built  around 6 GBP.Rock armour.Also known as riprap, rock armour are large rocks piled or placed at the foot of dunes or cliffs with native stones of the beach. This is generally used in areas prone to erosion to absorb the wave energy and hold beach material. Although effective, this solution is unpopular due to the fact that it is unsightly. Also, longshore drift is not hindered. Rock armour has a limited lifespan, it is not effective in storm conditions, and it reduces the recreational value of a beach. The cost is around 3000 per metre, depending on the type of rocks used.Gabions.Boulders and rocks are wired into mesh cages and usually placed in front of areas vulnerable to heavy erosion: sometimes at cliffs edges or jag out at a right angle to the beach like a large groyne. When the seawater breaks on the gabion, the water drains through leaving sediments, also the rocks and boulders absorb a moderate amount of the wave energy.Gabions need to be securely tied to prevent abrasion of wire by rocks, or detachment of plasticDownsides include wear rates and visual intrusiveness.Cost  est. 11 per mOffshore breakwater.Massive concrete blocks and natural boulders are sunk offshore to alter wave direction and to filter the energy of waves and tides. The waves break further offshore and therefore reduce their erosive power. This leads to wider beaches, which absorb the reduced wave energy, protecting cliff and settlements behind. The Dolos which was invented by a South African engineer in East London has replaced the use of enormous concrete blocks because the dolos is much more resistant to wave action and requires less concrete to produce a superior result. Similar concrete objects like the Dolos are the A-jack, Akmon, Xbloc and the Tetrapod, Accropode. Cost  est. 2,000 per m. Water depth may increase the cost.Cliff stabilization.Cliff stabilization can be accomplished through drainage of excess rainwater of through terracing, planting, and wiring to hold cliffs in place.Cliff drainage is used to hold a cliff together using plants, fences and terracing, this is used to help prevent landslides and other localized damage.Entrance training walls.Rock or concrete walls built to constrain a river or creek discharging across a sandy coastline. The walls help to stabilise and deepen the channel which benefits navigation, flood management, river erosion and water quality but can cause coastal erosion due to the interruption of longshore drift. One solution is the installation of a sand bypassing system to pump sand under and around the entrance training walls.Cost  Expensive  Gold Coast Seaway was a A$50M project in the 1980s and the adjacent sand bypassing project costs A$3M per year to pump 500,000 cubic meters of sand across the trained entrance.Floodgates.Storm surge barriers, or floodgates, were introduced after the North Sea Flood of 1953 and are a prophylactic method to prevent damage from storm surges or any other type of natural disaster that could harm the area they protect. They are habitually open and allow free passage, but close when the land is under threat of a storm surge. The Thames Barrier is an example of such a structure.Beach Replenishment.Beach replenishment or nourishment is one of the most popular soft engineering techniques of coastal defence management schemes. This involves importing sand off the beach and piling it on top of the existing sand. The imported sand must be of a similar quality to the existing beach material so it can integrate with the natural processes occurring there, without causing any adverse effects. Beach nourishment can be used alongside the groyne schemes. The scheme requires constant maintenance: 1 to 10-year life before first major recharge.Cost  est. 50-2000 per metre, plus control structures, ongoing management and minor works.Sand dune Management.Sand dune stabilisation or sand dune management works using a number of different methods in order to prevent the loss of sediment on the beach. Firstly the introduction of public amenities such as car parks, footpaths, Dutch Ladders and boardwalks, stop the removal of sediment by humans. Secondly, education of visitors with noticeboards, leaflets and beach wardens explain to visitors how to avoid damaging the area. Thirdly, by using fences constructed of simple materials such as wood, sand traps can create Blowouts. Furthermore, natural plants such as Ammophila, sometimes known as Marram Grass, is introduced to blowouts in order to bind the sediment together - preventing loss. Finally, areas of the beach can be simply closed to the public to allow rejuvenation to occur.Cost  est. of 1.1 million per annumBeach drainage====.Beach drainage or beach face dewatering lowers the water table locally beneath the beach face. This causes accretion of sand above the drainage system.Grant (1946)  the elevation of the beach watertable had an important bearing on deposition and erosion across the foreshore. A high watertable coincided with periods of accelerated beach erosion, and conversely, a low watertable coincided with pronounced aggradation of the foreshoreA lower watertable (unsaturated beach face) facilitates deposition by reducing flow velocities during backwash and prolonging laminar flow. In contrast, a high watertable results in condition favoring beach erosion. With the beach in a saturated state, Grant proposed that backwash velocity is accelerated by the addition of groundwater seepage out of the beach within the effluent zone.Turner and Leatherman (1997) moving from the origins and development of the dewatering concept to field and laboratory studies available at the time of writing concluded that there was too little evidence for being convinced that the systems had a positive effect. None of the case studies provide full scientific evidence of indisputable positive results regarding beach stabilisation although in some cases an overall positive performance was reported. In many cases no adequate long-term monitoring was undertaken at a frequency high enough to discriminate the response to high energy erosive events.A useful side effect of the system is that the collected seawater is very pure because of the sand filtration effect. It may be discharged back to sea but can also be used to oxygenate stagnant inland lagoons /marinas or used as feed for heat pumps, desalination plants, land-based aquaculture, aquariums or seawater swimming pools.Beach drainage systems have been installed in many locations around the world to halt and reverse erosion trends in sand beaches. Twenty four beach drainage systems have been installed since 1981 in Denmark, USA, UK, Japan, Spain, Sweden, France, Italy and Malaysia.The costs of installation and operation per meter of shoreline protection will vary due toThe costs associated with a beach drainage system are generally considerably lower than hard engineered structures. They also compare very favorably with beach nourishment projects, particularly when long-term project economics are considered (nourishment projects often have a limited life or a program of re-nourishment).Monitoring coastal zones.Coastal zone managers are faced with difficult and complex choices about how best to reduce property damage in the shorelines. One of the problems they face is error and uncertainty in the information available to them on the processes that cause erosion of beaches. Video-based monitoring lets collect data continuously at low cost and produce analyses of shoreline processes over a wide range of averaging intervals.Event warning systems.Event warning systems, such as tsunami warnings and storm surge warnings, can be used to minimize the human impact of catastrophic events that cause coastal erosion. Storm surge warnings can also be used to determine when to close floodgates to reduce the physical impact of such events.Wireless sensor networks can be deployed quickly to set up a coastal erosion monitoring system, and scaled accordingly.Shoreline mapping.Defining the shoreline is a difficult task due to the dynamic nature of the coast and the intended application of the shoreline (Graham et al. 2003; Boak & Turner 2005). Given this idea the shoreline must therefore be considered in a temporal sense whereby the scale is dependent on the context of the investigation (Boak & Turner 2005). The following definition of the coast and shoreline is most commonly employed for the purposes of shoreline mapping. The coast comprises the interface between land and sea, and the shoreline is represented by the margin between the two (Woodroffe, 2002). Due to the dynamic nature of the shoreline coastal investigators adopt the use of shoreline indicators to represent the true shoreline position (Boak & Turner 2005).Shoreline indicator.The choice of shoreline indicator is a primary consideration in shoreline mapping. According to Leatherman (2003) it is important that indicators are easily identified in the field and on aerial photography. Shoreline indicators may be physical beach morphological features such as the berm crest, scarp edge, vegetation line, dune toe, dune crest and cliff or the bluff crest and toe. Alternatively, non-morphological features may also be used. These indicators are based on water level including the high water line, mean high water line, wet/dry boundary, and the physical water line (Pajak & Leatherman 2000). Figure 1 provides a sketch of the spatial relationship between many of the commonly used shoreline indicators.The high water line (HWL), defined as the wet/dry line (H in Figure 1) is the most commonly used shoreline indicator because it is visible in the field, and can be interpreted on both colour and grey scale aerial photographs (Leatherman, 2003; Crowell et al. 1991). The HWL represents the landward extent of the most recent high tide and is characterised by a change in sand colour due to repeated, periodic inundation by high tides. The HWL is portrayed on aerial photographs by the most landward change in colour or grey tone (Boak & Turner 2005).Importance and application.The location of the shoreline and its changing position over time is of fundamental importance to coastal scientists, engineers and managers (Boak & Turner 2005; Pajack & Leatherman 2002). Present day shoreline monitoring campaigns provide information about historic shoreline location and movement, and about predictions of future change (Appeaning Addo et al. 2008). More specifically the position of the shoreline in the past, at present and where it is predicted to be in the future is useful for in the design of coastal protection, to calibrate and verify numerical models to assess sea level rise, map hazard zones and formulate policies to regulate coastal development. Accurate and consistent delineation of the shoreline is integral to all of these tasks. The location of the shoreline also provides information regarding shoreline reorientation adjacent to structures, beach width, volume and rates of historical change (Boak & Turner 2005; Pajack & Leatherman 2002).Data sources.A variety of data sources are available for examining shoreline position however, the availability of historical data is limited at many coastal sites and so the choice of data source is largely limited to what is available for the site at a given time (Boak & Turner 2005).Shoreline mapping techniques applied to data sources have moved towards automation in association with technological advances and the need to reduce uncertainty. Although these changes have resulted in improvement in coastal data processing and storage capabilities, the frequent change in technology has prevented the emergence of one standard method of shoreline mapping. This has occurred because each data source and associated method have their own unique capabilities and shortcomings (Moore 2000). A number of the data sources used for shoreline mapping and their associated advantages and disadvantages are discussed below.Historical maps.In the event that a study requires the shoreline position to be mapped before the development of aerial photographs, or if the location has poor photograph coverage it is necessary to employ historical maps in order to detail shoreline position (Moore 2000). The main advantage and reason for using historical maps is that they are able to provide a historic record that is not available from other data sources. Many potential errors however are associated with historical coastal maps and charts. Such errors may be associated with scale, datum changes, distortions from uneven shrinkage, stretching, creases, tears and folds, different surveying standards, different publication standards, and projection errors (Boak & Turner 2005). The severity of these errors depends on the accuracy standards met by each map and the physical changes that have occurred since the publication of the map (Anders & Byrnes 1991).The oldest reliable source of shoreline data in the United States dates back to the early-to-mid-19th century and is the U.S Coast and Geodetic Survey/National Ocean Service T-sheets (Morton 1991). In the United Kingdom, many maps and charts were deemed to be inaccurate until around 1750. The founding of the Ordnance Survey in 1791 has since improved the accuracy of the mapping.Aerial photographs.Aerial photographs have been used since the 1920s to provide topographical information about an area. They are therefore a good database for compilation of historical shoreline change maps. Aerial photographs are the most commonly used data source in shoreline mapping because many coastal areas have extensive aerial photo coverage therefore providing a valuable record of shoreline position (Moore 2000). In general, aerial photographs provide good spatial coverage of the coast however temporal coverage is very much site specific depending on the flight path of the aeroplane. A second disadvantage associated with aerial photography is that the interpretation of the shoreline position is subjective given the dynamic nature of the coastal environment. This combined with various distortions inherent in aerial photographs can lead to significant error levels (Moore 2000). The minimisation of further errors is discussed below.Object space displacements.Conditions outside of the camera can cause objects in an image to be displaced from their true ground position. Such conditions may include ground relief, camera tilt and atmospheric refraction.Relief displacement is prominent when photographing a variety of elevations. This situation causes objects above ground level to be displaced outward from the centre of the photograph and objects below ground level to be displaced toward the centre of the image (Figure 2). The severity of the displacement is affected negatively with decreases in flight altitude and as radial distance from the centre of the photograph increases. This distortion can be minimised by photographing numerous swaths and creating a mosaic of the images. This technique will create a focus for the centre of each photograph where distortion is minimised. It is important to note that this error is not common in shoreline mapping is the relief is fairly constant. It is however important to consider when mapping cliffs (Moore 2000).Ideally aerial photographs are taken so the optical axis of the camera is perfectly perpendicular to the ground surface thereby creating a vertical photograph. Unfortunately this is not often the case and virtually all aerial photographs experience tilt whereby up to 3 is not uncommon (Camfield et al. 1996). In this situation the scale of the image will be larger on the upward side of the tilt axis and smaller on the downward side. Moore, (2000) notes that many coastal researchers have not realised the severity of this error and therefore do not consider it in their methods.Radial lens distortion.Lens distortion varies as a function of radial distance from the iso-centre of the photograph meaning that the centre of the image is relatively distortion free, but as the angle of view increases the distortion becomes more prominent. This is a significant source of error in earlier aerial photography but as technology has increased and camera lens have become more refined it has become less of an issue with later photographs. Such a distortion is impossible to correct for without knowing the make and model of the lens used to capture the image. However, if overlapping images have been acquired one can digitize the centre portions of the aerial photographs (Crowell et al. 1991).Delineation of the shoreline.The dynamic nature of the coast has meant that accurate mapping of an instantaneous shoreline position has been associated with significant uncertainty. This uncertainty arises because at any given time the position of the shoreline is influenced by the short-term effect of the tide and a wide variety of long-term effects such as relative sea-level rise and along shore littoral sediment movement. Not only does this affect the accuracy of computed historic shoreline position but also any predicted future positions (Appeaning Addo et al. 2008).As mentioned earlier the HWL is most commonly used as a shoreline indicator. This can usually be seen as a significant tonal change on aerial photographs. There are however many errors associated with using the wet/dry line as a proxy for the HWL and shoreline. The errors of largest concern are the short-term migration of the wet/dry line, interpretation of the wet/dry line on a photograph and measurement of the interpreted line position (Leatherman 2003; Moore 2000). Systematic errors such as the migration of the wet/dry line may arise from tidal and seasonal changes. Storm-induced erosion is another factor which may cause the wet/dry line to migrate landward. Field investigations have shown that these changes can be minimised by using only summertime data (Moore 2000; Leatherman 2003). Furthermore, the error bar can be significantly reduced by using the longest record of reliable data to calculate erosion rates (Leatherman 2003). Finally it is important to note that errors may arise due to the difficulty of measuring a single line on a photograph. For example, where the pen line is 0.13mm thick this translates to an error of 2.6 m on a 1:20000 scale photograph.Beach profiling surveys.Beach profiling surveys are typically repeated at regular intervals along the coast in order to measure short-term (daily to annual) variations in shoreline position and beach volume. (Smith & Zarillo 1990). Beach profiling is a very accurate source of information however measurements are generally subject to the limitations of conventional surveying techniques. Shoreline data derived from beach profiling is often spatially and temporally limited due to the high cost associated with such a labour-intensive activity. Shorelines are generally derived by interpolating between a series of discrete beach profiles. It is important to note however that the distance between the profiles is usually quite large and so the accuracy of the interpolating becomes compromised. In contrast to aerial photographs, survey data is limited to smaller lengths of shoreline generally less than ten kilometres (Boak & Turner 2005). Beach profiling data is commonly available in from regional councils in New Zealand such as those compiled by the Hawkes Bay Regional Council.Remote sensing.Remote sensing techniques are attractive as they are cost effective, reduce manual error and remove the subjective approach of conventional field techniques (Maiti et al. 2009). Remote sensing is a relatively new concept and so extensive historical observations are unavailable. Given this idea, it is important that coastal morphology observations are quantified by coupling remotely sensed data with other sources of information detailing historic shoreline position from archived sources (Appeaning Addo et al. 2008).Video analysis.Video analysis provides quantitative, cost-effective, continuous and long-term monitoring beaches (Turner et al. 2004). The advancement of coastal video systems over the past 15 years has resulted in the extraction of large amounts of geophysical data from images. Such data includes that about coastal morphology, surface currents and wave parameters. The main advantage of video analysis lies in the ability to reliably quantify these parameters with high resolution and coverage in both space and time. This in particular highlights their potential importance as an effective coastal monitoring system and an aid to coastal zone management (Van Koningsveld et al. 2007). Interesting case studies have been carried out using video analysis. Turner et al. (2004) used a video-based ARGUS coastal imaging system to monitor and quantify the regional-scale coastal response to sand nourishment and construction of the world-first Gold Coast artificial (surfing) reef in Australia. In addition, Smit et al. (2007) demonstrated the added value of high resolution video observations for making short-term predictions of near shore hydrodynamic and morphological processes, at temporal scales of meters to kilometres and days to seasons.'),(37972852,'Kartalab_Khan_Mosque','Kartalab Khan Mosque.Kartalab Khan Mosque or Begum Bazar Mosque situated in the Begum Bazar area in old Dhaka, Bangladesh, was built by Nawab Diwan Murshid Quli Khan alias Kartalab Khan in 170104. It is located beside the modern Jail of the city. The mosque consists of a high valuated platform, a mosque with a Dochala annex on the north upon the western half of the platform and a Baoli or stepped well to the east of the platform. Unlike the three-domed mosques at Lalbagh Fort and Atishkhana, that is, the Khan Mohammad Mridha Mosque, it is roofed over by five Bulbous domes resting on octagonal drums. The whole mosque was once reconstructed by the Jamider of Dhaka, Mirza Golam Pir. In accordance with Murshid Quli Khan\'s wishes, he was buried under the entrance to this mosque.History.Kartalab Khan was appointed as Diwan or Revenue Administrator of Bengal by Emperor Aurangazeb, when Azim-ush-Shan was Viceroy. His original name was Murshid Quli Khan but he earned the title of Kartalab Khan from Emperor Aurangazwb for his efficiency in Revenue Administration. After coming to Bengal he erected a mosque at Dhaka, known after his name.Murshid Khuli Khan transferred the headquarters of the revenue administration from Dhaka to Mukshusabad, later on renamed Murshidabad in the year A.D. 1704 when a tussle started with the Subedar.The Mosque is undoubtedly one of the most impressive Mughal structures of Dhaka, having been built on a high platform called Tahkhana. Underneath the platform there is a series of rectangular rooms that are let out to shopkeepers. A kitchen market was built to meet the expenses of the mosque.In 1777, the control of the market was taken over by Begum daughter of the then Naib-e-Nazim Sharfaraz Khan. The name of the locality Begumbazar and the masjid originate from her name. The Baoli, the only known example of its kind in Bengal, is considered to be of North Indian or Deccan origin, the latter possibility being more likely since its builder had been in Deccen before coming to Dhaka.Architectural Value.The mosque proper and the do-chala annex occupy the western half of the vaulted terrace. The remaining part of the terrace was originally kept open, but is now covered with a masonry verandah.The mosque proper, inclusive of its corner towers, measures 28.658.23m and is entered from the east through five arched doorways  each opens out under a half-dome and is flanked by slender octagonal turrets which rise above the parapets. There is one doorway in the middle of each of the north and south walls. The western wall is internally recessed with five semi-octagonal mihrabs, all showing outward projections with bordering turrets. There is a three-stepped masonry pulpit beside the central mihrab.The interior of the mosque, forming a large elongated hall (25.60m by 5.18m), is divided into five bays by four transverse arches of plain four-centred design. The central bay is square and bigger than a couple of smaller rectangular ones on either side. All the bays are covered with domes on octagonal drums and crowned with lotus and kalasa finials. The device adopted for the support of the domes is the same as in the Lalbagh Fort mosque and the Satgumbad Mosque. The four octagonal corner towers, all rising above the horizontal parapets and having kalasa bases, are topped by renovated solid kiosks with copulas and finally crowned with lotus and kalasa finials. Each of these towers is again flanked to right and left by a slender turret, which rises above the parapet and ends in a small copula and kalasa finial.The rectangular annex of the mosque in the north is covered with a Bengali type of do-chala hut roof, the eaves of which have pronounced curves and are drooping. The annex (6.102.13m) has two doorways  one in the centre of the east wall, now renovated, and the other in the middle of the south side. It is through this latter opening that the annex and the mosque are interconnected. A window has been put in recently in the northern wall of the annex. Internally the four walls of the room are marked with rectangular and square deep niches, perhaps devised originally as shelves. The curved ridge is exterior crowned with five kalasa finials at intervals. This annex was thought to be a tomb, but probably it was originally meant for the Imam\'s accommodation since it is still used for that purpose.In decorating the building greater emphasis was given to architectural elements, such as flanking ornamental turrets of the doorway and mihrab projections, kiosks, cupolas, and lotus and kalasa finials. The doorways and the mihrabs are framed, with crowning rows of merlons. The parapets and octagonal drums are also enriched with merlon motifs. The inside of the domes have basal leaf ornamentation, while there are large medallions containing a rosette motif in the centre. The half-domed vault of the central archway is ornamented with muqarnas work in stucco, now in a crude form. Save these, the entire building is covered with plain plaster, a distinguishing feature of Mughal architecture in Bengal.The baoli of this mosque, which appears to be a monument by itself, deserves special mention. It is the only one of its kind in Bengal.'),(42797942,'Wharf_Horse_(or_How_Bob_Saves/Destroys_the_Town_%E2%80%93_Part_I)','Wharf Horse (or How Bob Saves/Destroys the Town  Part I).Wharf Horse (or How Bob Saves/Destroys the Town  Part I) is the 21st episode of the fourth season of the animated comedy series Bob\'s Burgers and the overall 66th episode, and is written by Nora Smith and directed by Brian Loschiavo. It aired on Fox in the United States on May 11, 2014.Plot.The episode opens with the Belcher children trying to give out flyers of the restaurant in front of Wonder Wharf. They see the owner and their landlord Calvin Fischoeder giving out free tickets of his own to attract customers, but to no avail. The Belcher children ditch the flyers and go inside the amusement park, where they find out that several of the rides were being replaced, specifically Tina\'s favorite carousel with odd-looking horses in it (such as what Tina calls Mr. Goiter.)Meanwhile, Mr. Fischoeder\'s brother Felix visits Bob at the restaurant. He persuades Bob into influencing his older brother into selling the amusement park in order for them to build high-end condominiums, promising Bob that he will give him a space for his own restaurant at the venue. While Linda is enthusiastic about the idea of earning more money, Bob has doubts. He is eventually convinced and proceeds to take Mr. Fischoeder to King\'s Head Island while Felix shows the contractors around Wonder Wharf.Tina tries to stop the demolition of the carousel. Louise locks her to Mr. Goiter with a bike lock and makes Tina swallow the key so the demolition would halt. Back in King\'s Head Island, Bob successfully convinces Mr. Fischoeder to sell Wonder Wharf. When they get back to the amusement park, Calvin announces that he\'s selling the place. Bob\'s kids get mad at him, with Tina telling him that the Wonder Wharf is the heart of the town. Bob realizes his mistake, which was driven by his desire to have a bistro-style restaurant. He then convinces Mr. Fischoeder to undo his decision. After talking to him, Calvin tells his brother that he will never sell the Wharf, which infuriates Felix. The episode ends with a cliffhanger -- where Felix points a gun at Calvin and Bob, intending to kill the both of them to be able to inherit and consequently sell the amusement park.Reception.Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying Throughout, Wharf Horse (Or How Bob Saves/Destroys The TownPart I) feels like the show taking the biggest possible swing and trying to do something its never done before. This really is the perfect time for that. At the end of a very successful fourth season and with its future as secure as its ever going to be, Bobs Burgers is in a place where it can step outside its normal structure and experiment with a slightly more dramatic form of storytelling. Robert Ham of Paste gave the episode an 10 out of 10, saying How Bobs Burgers achieved perfection tonight was by connecting all of its strengths to make one Voltron-like whole. All the throwaway lines from the characters were sharp and funny (Eugene, about to ride a roller coaster for the first time: Im going to die and I never got to see Hall & Oates!). They weaved in musical elements in ways that never felt corny or distracting, not even Tinas heartfelt Goodbye, Mr. Goiter  I love you so much! And the performances by all the voice talent were spot on, especially Jon Benjamins ability to convey so many different sides of Bob with the slightest inflection and Galifianakis as the mentally unhinged Felix.The episode received a 0.9 rating and was watched by a total of 1.97 million people.

They are particularly known for their recordings of works by Corelli, Rameau, Handel, and Bach.History.La Petite Bande\'s recordings of operatic rarities during their first ten years include Rameau\'s Zoroastre, Zas, and Pigmalion as well as Campra\'s L\'Europe galante and Grtry\'s Le jugement de Midas. From 2006 to 2012, the ensemble has largely concentrated on Bach, especially his cantatas with the goal of recording a complete liturgical year, but also his St John Passion, St Matthew Passion and Mass in B minor. Singers in these projects, each part sung by one singer, have included sopranos Gerlinde Smann, Barbara Schlick, Elisabeth Scholl and Siri Thornhill, altos Ren Jacobs and Petra Noskaiov, tenors Christoph Genz, Christoph Prgardien and Marcus Ullmann, and basses Jan van der Crabben, Max van Egmond and Harry van der Kamp.On 2 February 2009, Sigiswald Kuijken was awarded the Prize for Cultural Merit by the Belgian government. The following day, the advisory committee of the Ministry of Culture recommended that La Petite Bande\'s 600,000 euro annual subsidy be removed. Kuijken\'s students started an internet petition to save the subsidy which received 21,000 signatures. The Minister of Culture at the time, Bert Anciaux, ignored the advice of the committee and restored the subsidy until 2012 (reduced to 590,000 euro). The ensemble has since started a charitable foundation, Support La Petite Bande, to make up the shortfall. Some funding was subsequently granted for 2013 to 2016.In 2011, Kuijken decided to leave the future direction of the ensemble to younger musicians and chose the organist Benjamin Alard to direct a new Handel project which began in April 2013.'),(48038786,'Miller-McCoy_Academy','Miller-McCoy Academy.Miller-McCoy Academy for Mathematics and Business (MMA) was an all-boys\' charter secondary school in New Orleans East, New Orleans, Louisiana.

It was intended to promote business, technology, and mathematics.After being accused of ethics violations and cheating, the cofounders left the school in 2012. The school did not have a permanent principal until Eric Greely Sr. became the principal in the summer of 2013. Andrea Thomas-Reynolds was the chief executive of the board of directors of McCoy-Miller until January 2014; that month she was replaced by Walter Strong.As of August 2014 Greely had left his position, citing a lack of control over the hiring of employees and curriculum. Charles Layman Jr., a former teacher at McDonogh 35 High School and a principal in other New Orleans schools, became the interim principal. Layman resigned in December 2015.In November 2014 Patrick Dobard, the superintendent of the Recovery School District, stated that Miller-McCoy was on track to fail requireents for having its charter renewed. On the same day a 9th grade student stated in a Louisiana Board of Elementary and Secondary Education meeting that a lot of violence and chaos occurred at Miller-McCoy.In December 2014 the school\'s board of directors announced that it was closing the school.

As of 2010 it had a population of 781 people.History.A sanctuary from the Iron age in a site, called Mitesh and an ancient village at the site Pshenitseninata are the oldest traces of live near the village. A Thracian marble plates representing Bendida, Zeus and Hera were found at an altar used till 5th century. A medieval necropolis and more than 1000 coper and silver Byzantine coins have been unearthed at a site named Gogovo. Ruins from a medieval monastery St Ekaterina have been found at Babyaska chuka. The village was mentioned in an Ottoman register from 1576 year.Population and ethnicity.In the book Ethnographie des Vilayets d\'Andrinople, de Monastir et de Salonique in French the village was described as village with 892 households and more than 2100 male inhabitants of pomak origin as in 1873. In 1900 Vasil Kanchov wrote about a village with more than 3600 people of pomak origin. In 1916 D. Gadzhanov noted about 4780 pomak people, living in Babyak. Since 1954 - 1955 some neighborhoods of the village have been separated from the village and the population decreased.Religion.The population is Muslim of Pomak origin. In 1972 started a renaming process of the people of non-Bulgarian (Islamic) names and more than 400 men formed resistance groups,who tried to reach Sofia and to protest against the renaming, but they were stopped and arrested. One old man died after the incident.There is a very old mosque from 17th century.Education and culture.There is one primary school Stt Cyril and Methodius, a kindergarten, a nursery and a cultural center with library.Transportation and utilities.The village is connected with the national road system by a fourth class municipal road through the villages Lyutovo and Kraishte. There are roads to the neighboring villages: Kuzyovo, Chereshovo and Ortsevo. The road between Babyak and Lyutovo is in excellent condition, but the other roads need improvement. The roads are mountainous, narrow and steep and very difficult in the winter. There are no other types of transportation.Electricity is provided to all the neighborhoods of the village by aerial wires. Home and mobile phones are provided. There is a central sewerage and local water supply. A post office and a grocery work daily. The police station is in the village hall.'),(4301708,'Cochlear_nucleus','Cochlear nucleus.The cochlear nuclear complex comprises two nuclei, the ventral cochlear nucleus and the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The ventral cochlear nucleus is unlayered whereas the dorsal cochlear nucleus is layered. Auditory nerve fibers, fibers that travel through the auditory nerve (also known as the cochlear nerve or eighth cranial nerve) carry information from the inner ear, the cochlea, on the same side of the head, to the nerve root in the ventral cochlear nucleus. At the nerve root the fibers branch to innervate the ventral cochlear nucleus and the deep layer of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. All acoustic information thus enters the brain through the cochlear nuclei, where the processing of acoustic information begins. The outputs from the cochlear nuclei are received in higher regions of the auditory brainstem.Structure.The cochlear nuclei (CN) are located at the dorso-lateral side of the brainstem, spanning the junction of the pons and medulla.Projections to the cochlear nuclei.The major input to the cochlear nucleus is from the auditory nerve, a part of Cranial nerve VIII (the vestibulocochlear nerve). The auditory nerve fibers form a highly organized system of connections according to their peripheral innervation of the cochlea. Axons from the spiral ganglion cells of the lower frequencies innervate the ventrolateral portions of the ventral cochlear nucleus and lateral-ventral portions of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The axons from the higher frequency organ of corti hair cells project to the dorsal portion of the ventral cochlear nucleus and the dorsal-medial portions of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. The mid frequency projections end up in between the two extremes; in this way the tonotopic organization that is established in the cochlea is preserved in the cochlear nuclei. This tonotopic organization is preserved because only a few inner hair cells synapse on the dendrites of a nerve cell in the spiral ganglion, and the axon from that nerve cell synapses on only a very few dendrites in the cochlear nucleus. In contrast with the VCN that receives all acoustic input from the auditory nerve, the DCN receives input not only from the auditory nerve but it also receives acoustic input from neurons in the VCN (T stellate cells). The DCN is therefore in a sense a second order sensory nucleus.The cochlear nuclei have long been thought to receive input only from the ipsilateral ear. There is evidence, however, for stimulation from the contralateral ear via the contralateral CN, and also the somatosensory parts of the brain.Projections from the cochlear nuclei.There are three major fiber bundles, axons of cochlear nuclear neurons, that carry information from the cochlear nuclei to targets that are mainly on the opposite side of the brain. Through the medulla, one projection goes to the contralateral superior olivary complex (SOC) via the trapezoid body, whilst the other half shoots to the ipsilateral SOC. This pathway is called the ventral acoustic stria (VAS or, more commonly, the trapezoid body). Another pathway, called the dorsal acoustic stria (DAS, also known as the stria of von Monakow), rises above the medulla into the pons where it hits the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus along with its kin, the intermediate acoustic stria (IAS, also known as the stria of Held). The IAS decussates across the medulla, before joining the ascending fibers in the contralateral lateral lemniscus. The lateral lemniscus contains cells of the nuclei of the lateral lemniscus, and in turn projects to the inferior colliculus. The inferior colliculus receives direct, monosynaptic projections from the superior olivary complex the contralateral dorsal acoustic stria, some classes of stellate neurons of the VCN, as well as from the different nuclei of the lateral lemniscus.Most of these inputs terminate in the inferior colliculus, although there are a few small projections that bypass the inferior colliculus and project to the medial geniculate, or other forebrain structures.Histology.Three types of principal cells convey information out of the ventral cochlear nucleus: Bushy cells, stellate cells, and octopus cells.Two types of principal cells convey information out of the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DCN) to the contralateral inferior colliculus. The principal cells receive two systems of inputs. Acoustic input comes to the deep layer through several paths. Excitatory acoustic input comes from auditory nerve fibers and also from stellate cells of the VCN. Acoustic input is also conveyed through inhibitory interneurons (tuberculoventral cells of the DCN and wide band inhibitors in the VCN). Through the outermost molecular layer, the DCN receives other types of sensory information, most importantly information about the location of the head and ears, through parallel fibers. This information is distributed through a cerebellar like circuit that also includes inhibitory interneurons.Function.The cochlear nuclear complex is the first integrative, or processing, stage in the auditory system. Information is brought to the nuclei from the ipsilateral cochlea via the cochlear nerve. Several tasks are performed in the cochlear nuclei. By distributing acoustic input to multiple types of principal cells, the auditory pathway is subdivided into parallel ascending pathways, which can simultaneously extract different types of information. The cells of the ventral cochlear nucleus extract information that is carried by the auditory nerve in the timing of firing and in the pattern of activation of the population of auditory nerve fibers. The cells of the dorsal cochlear nucleus perform a non-linear spectral analysis and place that spectral analysis into the context of the location of the head, ears and shoulders and that separate expected, self-generated spectral cues from more interesting, unexpected spectral cues using input from the auditory cortex, pontine nuclei, trigeminal ganglion and nucleus, dorsal column nuclei and the second dorsal root ganglion. It is likely that these neurons help mammals to use spectral cues for orienting toward those sounds. The information is used by higher brainstem regions to achieve further computational objectives (such as sound source location or improvement in signal to noise ratio). The inputs from these other areas of the brain probably play a role in sound localization.In order to understand in more detail the specific functions of the cochlear nuclei it is first necessary to understand the way sound information is represented by the fibers of the auditory nerve. Briefly, there are around 30,000 auditory nerve fibres in each of the two auditory nerves. Each fiber is an axon of a spiral ganglion cell that represents a particular frequency of sound, and a particular range of loudness. Information in each nerve fibre is represented by the rate of action potentials as well as the particular timing of individual action potentials. The particular physiology and morphology of each cochlear nucleus cell type enhances different aspects of sound information.'),(13017962,'Israel_Hands','Israel Hands.Israel Hands was an 18th-century pirate, also known as Basilica Hands. He is best known for being second in command to Edward Teach, better known as Blackbeard. Hands\' first historical mention was in 1718, when Blackbeard gave him command of David Herriot\'s ship Adventure after Herriot was captured by Teach in March 1718.Captain Charles Johnson wrote that Hands was shot in the knee by Teach after Teach fired at another of his crew, missing him but striking Hands. Hands supposedly asked Teach for his reasons, whereupon Teach remarked that, if he did not now and then kill one of them, they would forget who he was. Another theory is that Teach shot him so that he would not die in the battle against Robert Maynard.Teach was killed by Maynard, and Hands was captured and taken to Virginia for trial. In exchange for a pardon, Hands testified against corrupt North Carolina officials with whom Teach had consorted. What happened to Hands after this is not known for certain; however, in Captain Charles Johnson\'s A General History of the Pyrates, Hands is said to have died a beggar in London.Popular culture.One of Long John Silver\'s pirates is named Israel Hands in the book Treasure Island and films based on it, though the pirate is described as the late Captain Flint\'s gunner and no mention is made of Blackbeard.

Romney used the phrase in response to a question about pay equality, referring to binders with resumes of female job applicants submitted to him as Governor of Massachusetts. This prompted the phrase\'s use for political attacks on Romney\'s positions on women\'s issues, as well as the development of an Internet meme.At the debate, Romney said: I had the chance to pull together a cabinet, and all the applicants seemed to be men I went to a number of women\'s groups and said, \'Can you help us find folks?\' and they brought us whole binders full of women. Even while the debate was ongoing, humorous commentary about the phrase had begun to be published online.Internet meme.By the day after the debate, a Tumblr blog and posts had been created illustrating commentary on the phrase, tweets and original works of art had been produced, and a Facebook page about Binders Full of Women had received 274,000 likes.

He reinforced central authority and forced his subjects to accept Christianity. Although written sources emphasize the role played by German and Italian knights and clerics in the process, a significant part of the Hungarian vocabulary for agriculture, religion and state was taken from Slavic languages. Civil wars and pagan uprisings, along with attempts by the Holy Roman Emperors to expand their authority over Hungary, jeopardized the new monarchy. The monarchy stabilized during the reigns of Ladislaus I (10771095) and Coloman (10951116). These rulers occupied Croatia and Dalmatia, but both realms retained their autonomous position. Their successorsespecially Bla II (11311141), Bla III (11761196), Andrew II (12051235), and Bla IV (12351270)continued this policy of expansion towards the Balkan Peninsula and the lands east of the Carpathian Mountains, transforming their kingdom into one of the major powers of medieval Europe.Rich in uncultivated lands, silver, gold, and salt deposits, Hungary became the preferred destination of mainly German, Italian and French colonists. These immigrants were mostly peasants who settled in villages, but craftsmen and merchants also came. Their arrival had a key role in the shaping of an urban lifestyle, habits and culture in medieval Hungary. The location of the kingdom at the crossroads of international trade routes favored the coexistence of several cultures. Romanesque, Gothic and Renaissance buildings and literary works written in Latin prove the predominantly Roman Catholic character of the culture, but Orthodox, and even non-Christian ethnic minority communities also existed. Latin was the language of legislation, administration and judiciary, but linguistic pluralism contributed to the survival of many tongues, including a great variety of Slavic dialects.The predominance of royal estates initially assured the sovereign\'s preeminent position, but the alienation of royal lands gave rise to the emergence of a self-conscious group of lesser landholders, known as royal servants. They forced Andrew II to issue his Golden Bull of 1222, one of first examples of constitutional limits being placed on the powers of a European monarch (Francis Fukuyama). The kingdom received a major blow from the Mongol invasion of 124142. Thereafter, Cuman and Jassic groups settled in the central lowlands, and colonists arrived from Moravia, Poland and other nearby countries. The erection of fortresses by landlords, promoted by the monarchs after the withdrawal of the Mongols, led to the development of semi-autonomous provinces dominated by powerful magnates. Some of these magnates even challenged the authority of Andrew III (12901301), the last male descendant of the native rpd dynasty. His death was followed by a period of interregnum and anarchy. Central power was re-established only in the early 1320s.Background.The Hungarians, or Magyars, conquered the Carpathian Basin at the turn of the 9th and 10th centuries. Here they found a predominantly Slavic-speaking population. From their new homeland, they launched plundering raids against East Francia, Italy and other regions of Europe. Their raids were halted by Otto I, future Holy Roman Emperor, who defeated them at the Battle of Lechfeld in 955.Hungarians lived in patrilineal families, which were organized into clans that formed tribes. The tribal confederation was headed by the grand prince, always a member of the family descending from rpd, the Hungarians\' leader around the time of their land-taking. Contemporary authors described the Hungarians as nomads, but Ibn Rusta and others added that they also cultivated arable land. The great number of borrowings from Slavic languages prove that the Hungarians adopted new techniques and a more settled lifestyle in Central Europe. The cohabitation of Hungarians and local ethnic groups is also reflected in the assemblages of the Bijelo Brdo culture, which emerged in the mid-10th century.Although they were pagan, the Hungarians demonstrated a tolerant attitude towards Christians, Jews, and Muslims. The Byzantine Church was the first to successfully proselytize among their leaders: in 948 the horka, and around 952 the gyula, were baptized in Constantinople. In contrast, the grand prince Gza (c.970997) received baptism according to the Latin rite. He erected fortresses and invited foreign warriors to develop a new army based on heavy cavalry. Gza also arranged the marriage of his son, Stephen, with Giselle of Bavaria, a princess from the family of the Holy Roman Emperors.When Gza died in 997, his son had to fight for his succession with Koppny, the eldest member of the House of rpd. Assisted by German heavy cavalry, Stephen emerged the victor in the decisive battle in 998. He applied for a royal crown to Pope Sylvester II, who granted his request with the consent of Emperor Otto III.King St Stephen (10001038).Stephen was crowned the first king of Hungary on either December 25, 1000, or January1, 1001. He consolidated his rule through a series of wars against semi-independent local rulers, including his maternal uncle, Gyula. He proved his kingdom\'s military strength when he repelled an invasion by Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor, in 1030. Marshlands, other natural obstacles, and barricades made of stone, earth or timber provided defense at the kingdom\'s borders. A wide zone known as gyep was intentionally left uninhabited for defensive purposes along the frontiers. Most of the early medieval fortresses in Hungary were made of earth and timber.Stephen I\'s views on state administration were summarized around 1015 in a work known as Admonitions. Stating that the country that has only one language and one custom is weak and fragile, he emphasized the advantages of the arrival of foreigners, or guests. StephenI developed a state similar to the monarchies of contemporary Western Europe. Counties, the basic units of administration, were districts organized around fortresses and headed by royal officials known as ispns, or counts. StephenI founded dioceses and at least one archbishopric, and established Benedictine monasteries. He prescribed that every tenth village was to build a parish church. The earliest churches of the 10th century were simple wood constructions, but the royal basilica at Szkesfehrvr was built in Romanesque style. StephenI\'s laws were aimed at the adoption, even by force, of a Christian way of life. He especially protected Christian marriage against polygamy and other traditional customs. Decorated belts and other items of pagan fashion also disappeared. Commoners started to wear long woolen coats, but wealthy men persisted with their silk kaftans decorated with furs.From a legal perspective, Hungarian society was divided into freemen and serfs, but intermediate groups also existed. All freemen had the legal capacity to own property, to sue and to be sued. However, most of them were bound to the monarch or to a wealthier landlord, and only guests could freely move. Among freemen living in lands attached to a fortress, the castle warriors served in the army, and the castle folk cultivated the lands, forged weapons or rendered other services. All freemen were to pay a special tax, the pennies of freemen to the monarchs. With a transitory status between freemen and serfs, peasants known as udvornici were exempt from it. Serfs theoretically lacked legal personality, but in practise they had their own property: they cultivated their masters\' land with their own tools, and kept 5066percent of the harvest for themselves. StephenI\'s laws and charters suggest that most communers lived in sedentary communities which formed villages. An average village was made up of no more than 40 semi-sunken timber huts with a corner hearth. Many of the villages were named after a profession, implying that the villagers were required to render a specific service to their lords.Pagan revolts, wars and consolidation (10381116).Stephen I survived his son, Emeric, which caused a four-decade crisis. Stephen considered his cousin, Vazul, unsuitable for the throne and named his own sister\'s son, the Venetian Peter Orseolo, as his heir. Vazul was blinded and his three sons were expelled, thus Peter succeeded his uncle without opposition in 1038. However, Peter\'s preference for his foreign courtiers led to a rebellion, which ended with his deposition in favor of a native lord, Samuel Aba, who was related to the royal family. Supported by Emperor Henry III, Peter Orseolo returned and expelled Samuel Aba in 1044. During his second rule, he accepted the emperor\'s suzerainty. His rule ended with a new rebellion, on this occasion aimed at the restoration of paganism. However, there were many lords who opposed the destruction of the Christian monarchy. They proposed the crown to Andrew, one of Vazul\'s sons, who returned to Hungary, defeated Peter and suppressed the pagans in 1046. His cooperation with his brother, Bla, a talented military commander, ensured the Hungarians\' victory over Emperor Henry III, who in 1050 and 1053.A new civil war broke out when Duke Bla claimed the crown for himself in 1059, but his three sons accepted the rule of Solomon, Andrew I\'s son, in 1063. Initially, the young king and his cousins cooperated; for instance, they jointly defeated the Pechenegs plundering Transylvania in 1068. The power conflict in the royal family caused a new civil war in 1071. It lasted up to Solomon\'s abdication in favor of one of his cousins, Ladislaus in the early 1080s.King Ladislaus promulgated laws that prescribed draconian punishments against criminals. His laws also regulated the payment of customs duties, tolls payable at fairs and fords, and of the tithes. He forbade Jews from holding Christian serfs, and introduced laws aiming at the conversion of local Muslims, who were known as Bszrmnys.The death of Ladislaus\' brother-in-law, King Zvonimir of Croatia, in 1089 or 1090 created an opportunity for him to claim Croatia for himself. His troops soon occupied most of Croatia; only a native claimant, Petar Svai, resisted in the Petrova Mounts. Nevertheless, hereafter Croatia and Hungary remained closely connected for more than nine centuries. LadislausI appointed his nephew, lmos, to administer Croatia. Although a younger son, lmos was also favored against his brother, Coloman, when the king was thinking of his succession. Even so, Coloman succeeded his uncle in 1095, while lmos received a separate duchy under his brother\'s suzerainty. Throughout Coloman\'s reign, the brothers\' relationship remained tense, which finally led to the blinding of lmos and his infant son.Coloman routed two bands of crusaders who were plundering the Western borderlands and defeated Petar Svai in Croatia. The late 14th-century Pacta conventa states that Coloman was crowned king of Croatia after concluding an agreement with twelve local noblemen. Although most probably a forgery, the document reflects the actual status of Croatia proper, which was never incorporated into Hungary. In contrast, the region known as Slavonia, between the Petrova Mounts and the river Drva, became closely connected to Hungary. Here many Hungarian noblemen received land grants from the monarchs. Zadar, Split and other Dalmatian towns also accepted Coloman\'s suzerainty in 1105, but their right to elect their own bishops and leaders remained unchained. In Croatia and Slavonia, the sovereign was represented by governors bearing the title ban. Likewise, a royal official, the voivode, administered Transylvania, the eastern borderland of the kingdom.Like Ladislaus I, Coloman proved to be a great legislator, but he prescribed less severe punishments than his uncle had done. He ordered that transactions between Christians and Jews were to be put into writing. His laws concerning his Muslim subjects aimed at their conversion, for instance, by obliging them to marry their daughters to Christians. The presence of Jewish and Muslim merchants in the kingdom was due to its role as a crossroad of trading routes leading towards Constantinople, Regensburg and Kiev. Local trade also existed, which enabled Coloman to collect the marturina, the traditional in-kind tax of Slavonia, in cash.The kingdom, with its average population density of four or five people per, was sparsely populated. The Olaszi streets or districts in Eger, Pcs and Nagyvrad (Oradea, Romania) point at the presence of guests speaking a Western Romance language, while the Nmeti and Szszi place names refer to German-speaking colonists throughout the entire kingdom. Most subjects of the early medieval Hungarian monarchs were peasants. They only cultivated the most fertile lands, and moved further when the lands became exhausted. Wheat was the most widely produced crop, but barley, the raw material for home brew, was also grown. Animal husbandry remained an important sector of agriculture, thus millet and oats were produced for fodder. Fishing and hunting also contributed to nourishing, since even peasants were allowed to hunt in the royal forests that covered large territories in the kingdom.Colonisation and expansion (11161196).Unsuccessful wars with the Republic of Venice, the Byzantine Empire and other neighboring states characterized the reign of Coloman\'s son, Stephen II, who succeeded his father in 1116. The earliest mention of the Szkelys is in connection with the young king\'s first war against the Duchy of Bohemia. The Hungarian-speaking Szkelys lived in scattered communities along the borders, but their groups were moved to the easternmost regions of Transylvania in the 12th century. StephenII died childless in 1131. During the reign of the blind Bla II, the kingdom was administered by his wife, Helena of Rascia, who ordered the massacre of the lords who had opposed her husband\'s rule. Boris Kalamanos, an alleged son of King Coloman, who attempted to seize the throne from BlaII, received no internal support.Bla II\'s son, Gza II, who ascended the throne in 1141, adopted an active foreign policy. He supported Uro II of Rascia against Emperor Manuel I Komnenos. He promoted the colonization of the border zones. Flemish, German, Italian, and Walloon guests arrived in great numbers and settled in the Szepessg region (Spi, Slovakia) and in southern Transylvania. Gza even recruited Muslim warriors in the Pontic steppes to serve in his army. Abu Hamid, a Muslim traveler from Al-Andaluz refers to mountains that contain lots of silver and gold, which points at the importance of mining and gold panning already around 1150.Gza II was succeeded in 1162 by his eldest son, Stephen III. However, his uncles, Ladislaus II and Stephen IV, claimed the crown for themselves. Emperor ManuelI Komnenos took advantage of the internal conflicts and forced the young king to cede Dalmatia and the Szermsg region (Srem, Serbia) to the Byzantines in 1165. StephenIII set an example for the development of towns by granting liberties to the Walloon guests in Szkesfehrvr, including their immunity of the jurisdiction of the local ispn.When Stephen III died childless in 1172, his brother, Bla III, ascended the throne. He reconquered Dalmatia and the Szermsg in the 1180s. A contemporary list shows that more than 50percent of his revenues derived from the annual renewal of the silver currency, and from tolls, ferries and markets. According to the list, his total income was the equivalent of 32 tonnes of silver per year, but this number is clearly exaggerated. BlaIII emphasized the importance of making records on judicial proceedings, which substantiates reports in later Hungarian chronicles\' of his order regarding the obligatory use of written petitions. Landowners also started to put their transactions into writing, which led to the appearance of the so-called places of authentication, such as cathedral chapters and monasteries authorized to issue deeds. Their emergence also evidences the employment of an educated staff. Indeed, students from the kingdom studied at the universities of Paris, Oxford, Bologna and Padua from the 1150s.Aspects of 12th-century French culture could also be detected in BlaIII\'s kingdom. His palace at Esztergom was built in the early Gothic style. Achilles and other names known from the Legend of Troy and the Romance of Alexander (two emblematic works of chivalric culture) were also popular among Hungarian aristocrats. According to a scholarly view, MasterP, the author of the Gesta Hungarorum, a chronicle on the Hungarian land-taking, was BlaIII\'s notary.Age of Golden Bulls (11961241).Bla III\'s son and successor, Emeric, had to face revolts stirred up by his younger brother, Andrew. Furthermore, incited by Enrico Dandolo, Doge of Venice, the armies of the Fourth Crusade took Zadar in 1202. Emeric was succeeded in 1204 by his infant son, Ladislaus III. When the young king died in a year, his uncle, Andrew, mounted the throne. Stating that the best measure of a royal grant is its being immeasurable, he distributed large parcels of royal lands among his partisans. Freemen living in former royal lands lost their direct contact to the sovereign, which threatened their legal status. Royal revenues decreased, which led to the introduction of new taxes and their farming out to Muslims and Jews.Andrew II was strongly influenced by his wife, Gertrude of Merania. She openly expressed her preference for her German compatriots, which caused her assassination by a group of local lords in 1213. A new uprising broke out while the king was in the Holy Land on his crusade in 1217 and 1218. Finally, a movement of the royal servants, who were actually free landholders directly subordinated to the sovereign, obliged AndrewII to issue his Golden Bull in 1222. It summarized the royal servants\' liberties, including their tax exemption. Its last provision authorized the secular and spiritual lords to resist and speak against the sovereign without the charge of high treason. The Golden Bull also prohibited the employment of Muslims and Jews in royal administration. This ban was confirmed when AndrewII, urged by the prelates, issued the Golden Bull\'s new variant in 1231, which authorized the archbishop of Esztergom to excommunicate him in case of his departure from its provisions. For non-Christians who continued to be employed in the royal household, Archbishop Robert of Esztergom placed the kingdom under interdict in 1232. AndrewII was forced to take an oath, which included his promise to respect the privileged position of clergymen and to dismiss all his Jewish and Muslim officials. A growing intolerance against non-Catholics is also demonstrated by the transfer of the Orthodox monastery of Visegrd to the Benedictines in 1221.Andrew II made several attempts to occupy the neighboring Principality of Halych. His son, Bla, persuaded a group of Cumans to accept AndrewII\'s suzerainty in 1228 and established a new march in Oltenia (known as the Banate of Szrny) in 1231. Bla IV succeeded his father in 1235. His attempt to reacquire crown lands alienated by his predecessors created a deep rift between the monarch and the lords just as the Mongols were sweeping westward across the Eurasian steppes.The king was first informed of the Mongol threat by Friar Julian, a Dominican monk who had visited a Hungarian-speaking population in Magna Hungaria, in 1235. In the next years, the Mongols routed the Cumans who dominated the western parts of the Eurasian steppes. A Cuman chieftain, Kuthen, agreed to accept BlaIV\'s supremacy; thus he and his people were allowed to settle in the Great Hungarian Plain. However, the Cumans\' nomadic lifestyle caused many conflicts with local communities. The locals even considered them as the Mongols\' allies.Mongol invasion (12411242).Batu Khan, who was the commander of the Mongol armies invading Eastern Europe, demanded Bla IV\'s surrender without a fight in 1240. The king refused, and ordered his barons to assemble with their retinue in his camp at Pest. Here, a riot broke out against the Cumans and the mob massacred the Cuman leader, Kuthen. The Cumans soon departed and pillaged the central parts of the kingdom. The main Mongol army arrived through the northeastern passes of the Carpathian Mountains in March 1241. Royal troops met the enemy forces at the river Saj, where the Mongols won a decisive victory in the battle of Mohi on April 11, 1241. From the battlefield, Bla IV fled first to Austria, where Duke Frederick II held him for ransom. Thereafter, the king and his family found refuge in Klis Fortress in Dalmatia. The Mongols first occupied and thoroughly plundered the territories east of the river Danube. They crossed the river when it was frozen in early 1242. A contemporary account by Abbot Hermann of Niederalteich stated that the Kingdom of Hungary, which had existed for 350 years, was destroyed.However, the kingdom did not cease to exist. Batu Khan withdrew his entire army when he was informed of the death of the Great Khan, gdei in March 1242. Nevertheless, the invasion and the famine that followed it had catastrophic demographic consequences. At least 15percent of the population died or disappeared. Transcontinental trading routes disintegrated, causing the decline of Bcs (Ba, Serbia), Ungvr (Uzhhorod, Ukraine) and other traditional centers of commerce. Local Muslim communities also disappeared, indicating they had suffered especially heavy losses during the invasion.Last rpds (12421301).After the Mongol withdrawal, Bla IV abandoned his policy of recovering former crown lands. Instead, he granted large estates to his supporters, and urged them to construct stone-and-mortar castles. He initiated a new wave of colonization that resulted in the arrival of a number of Germans, Moravians, Poles, and Romanians. The king re-invited the Cumans and settled them in the plains along the Danube and the Tisza. A group of Alans, the ancestors of the Jassic people, seems to have settled in the kingdom around the same time.New villages appeared, consisting of timber houses built side by side in equal parcels of land. For instance, the settlement network of the so far scarcely inhabited forests of the Western Carpathians (in present-day Slovakia) began to develop under Bla IV. Huts disappeared, and new rural houses consisting of a living room, a kitchen and a pantry were built. The most advanced agricultural techniques, including asymmetric heavy ploughs, also spread throughout the kingdom.Internal migration was likewise instrumental in the development of the new domains emerging in former royal lands. The new landholders granted personal freedom and more favorable financial conditions to those who arrived in their estates, which also enabled the peasants who decided not to move to improve their position. BlaIV granted privileges to more than a dozen towns, including Nagyszombat (Trnava, Slovakia) and Pest.Although threatening letters sent to BlaIV by the khans of the Golden Horde proved that the danger of a new Mongol invasion still existed, he adopted an expansionist foreign policy. FrederickII of Austria died fighting against Hungarian troops in 1246, and BlaIV\'s son-in-law, Rostislav Mikhailovich, annexed large territories along the kingdom\'s southern frontiers. However, conflicts between the elderly monarch and his heir, Stephen, caused a civil war in the 1260s.Bla IV and his son jointly confirmed the liberties of the royal servants, hereafter known as noblemen in 1267. By that time, true noblemen were legally differentiated from other landholders. They held their estates free from any obligation, but everybody else (even the ecclesiastic nobles, Romanian cneazes and other conditional nobles) owed services to their lords in exchange for the lands they held. In a growing number of counties, local nobility acquired the right to elect four or two judges of the nobles to represent them in official procedures. The idea of equating the Hungarian nation with the community of noblemen also emerged in this period. It was first expressed in Simon of Kza\'s Gesta Hungarorum, a chronicle written in the 1280s.The wealthiest landholders forced the lesser nobles to join their retinue, which increased their power. One of the barons, Joachim of the Gutkeled clan, even captured StephenV\'s heir, the infant Ladislaus, in 1272. StephenV died some months later, causing a new civil war between the Csk, Kszegi, and other leading families who attempted to control the central government in the name of the young LadislausIV. He was declared to be of age in 1277 at an assembly of the spiritual and temporal lords and of the noblemen\'s and Cumans\' representatives, but he could not strengthen royal authority. LadislausIV, whose mother, Elisabeth, was a Cuman chieftain\'s daughter, preferred his Cuman kin, which made him unpopular. He was even accused of initiating a second Mongol invasion in 1285, although the invaders were routed by the royal troops.When Ladislaus IV was murdered in 1290, the Holy See declared the kingdom a vacant fief and granted it to his sister\'s son, Charles Martel, crown prince of the Kingdom of Naples. However, the majority of the Hungarian lords chose Andrew, the grandson of AndrewII, even though his father\'s legitimacy was dubious. Andrew became the first monarch to take an oath on respecting the liberties of the Church and the nobility before his coronation. He regularly convoked the prelates, the lords and the noblemen\'s representatives to assemblies known as Diets, which started to develop into a legislative body. However, the kingdom disintegrated into autonomous provinces, each ruled by powerful noblemen (including Matthew Csk, Ladislaus Kn, and Amadeus Aba) who ignored the king\'s authority. The powerful Croatian lord, Paul I ubi of Bribir, even dared to invite the late Charles Martel\'s son, the twelve-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary in 1300. The young pretender was marching from Croatia towards Buda when AndrewIII unexpectedly died on January 14, 1301.Aftermath.With Andrew III\'s death, the male line of the House of rpd became extinct, and a period of anarchy began. Charles Robert was crowned king with a provisional crown, but most lords and bishops refused to yield to him because they regarded him as a symbol of the Holy See\'s attempts to control Hungary. They elected king the twelve-year-old Wenceslaus of Bohemia, who was descended from Bla IV of Hungary in the female line. However, the young king could not consolidate his position because many lords, especially those who held domains in the southern region of the kingdom, continued to support Charles Robert. Wenceslaus left Hungary for Bohemia in the summer of 1304. After he inherited Bohemia in 1305, he abandoned his claim to Hungary in favor of Otto III, Duke of Bavaria.Otto, who was a grandson of BlaIV of Hungary, was crowned king, but only the Kszegis and the Transylvanian Saxons regarded him as the lawful monarch. He was captured in Transylvania by Ladislaus Kn, who forced him to leave Hungary. The majority of the lords and prelates elected Charles Robert king at a Diet on October10, 1307. He was crowned king with the Holy Crown of Hungary in Szkesfehrvr by the Archbishop of Esztergom, as it was required by customary law, on August27, 1310. During the next decade, he launched a series of military campaigns against the oligarchs to restore royal authority. Charles Robert reunited the kingdom after the death of the most powerful lord, Mattheus Csk, which enabled him to conquer Csk\'s large province in the northeast of Hungary in 1321.'),(28930205,'Haiti_Reconstruction_Fund','Haiti Reconstruction Fund.The Haiti Reconstruction Fund (HRF) is a partnership between the international community and the Government of Haiti to help finance post-earthquake reconstruction.

It is located on the Plaza Mayor of Lima, in the Historic Centre of Lima.The palace is also headquarters to the offices of the cardinal of Peru who is Juan Luis Cipriani, who is also the archbishop of Lima.History.Located on the land that Francisco Pizarro allocated to be the residence of the head priest of Lima after the foundation of the city in 1535, the current building was opened on December 8, 1924 and is considered a prime example of neo-colonial architectural that developed in Lima during the early twentieth century.The old Archbishop\'s Palace was built on the place the Limean cabildo had occupied from 1535 to 1548, when that institution moved to its current location across the square. The building had six balconies of different styles and several entrances, displaying the Archdiocese coat of arms above the main gate. The architectural features of the courtyard were similar to those of several cloisters in the city. The old palace faade was demolished in the late 19th century along the Sagrario. The remaining structure was demolished prior to the construction of the present Archbishop\'s palace.The current building was designed by the Polish Peruvian architect Ricardo de Jaxa Malachowski, who used the Torre Tagle Palace as a reference point. Erected joined to the Cathedral of Lima, the location formerly belonged to the city\'s first police station and the city\'s first jail. After Pope Paul III designated this temple as the primary church headquarters of the city, the location became the current location of the Archdiocese.The facade is made up of baroque elements, completely made of reintegrated rock; ornate cedar balconies are located over the main doors, and the palace is finished by a granite sculpture of Saint Turibius of Mongrovejo the patron protector of the Archdiocese. The palace also consists of two flagpoles, one for the Peruvian flag and another for flag of the Vatican.

He previously served as Minister of Urban Development and Housing for two terms (2002-2003, 2005-2010) and Governor of Kandahar province, in 2003 replacing Gul Agha Sherzai.Biography.Yousef Pashtun, an ethnic Pashtun of the Barakzai tribe, was born in the city of Kandahar. He was born to one of the elite families of Kandahar on November 15, 1946. His grandfather, General Mohammad Nabi Khan was the Army Chief of Southern Zone of Afghanistan during the Third Afghan - Anglo War under the command of King Amanullah Khan. His father, Brigadier Mohammad Ghani Khan, served as Corps Commander of Eastern and afterwards Northern Zone of Afghanistan. His maternal grandfather Haji Gul Muhammad Khan was an active politician and key figure in Southern Afghanistan\'s political leadership. His father in law Faiz Mohammad Angar was a famous political activist, reformist and Editor in Chief of weekly newspaper Angar (Burning Embers). Pashtun graduated from Ahmad Shah Baba High School in 1965. He began studying Engineering at Kabul University, and being ranked in top 10 of Afghanistan\'s Higher Secondary Board Exam, he soon received a USAID/Kabul University scholarship to attend American University of Beirut in Lebanon, where Pashtun earned a Bachelor\'s degree in Architecture, and two Masters degrees, one in Architecture (1973) and Urban Design and Planning (1977).After his double Masters, he worked in Dar-ul-Handasa Design & Construction Company in the Middle East. Under this company he worked on the master plans of Dubai and Ras-al-Khaima cities. After his return to Afghanistan he worked as a Lecturer in Engineering Faculty of Kabul University.During Soviet invasion.After the Soviet Invasion, Yousef Pashtun escaped three times from Soviet troops and finally had to leave Afghanistan, and he took refuge to Pakistan. In Pakistan he started helping the Mujaheedin(The Afghan fighters against Soviet Troops). He started to provide Foreign aid to the Mujaheedin and also founded Al-Jehad Hospital for free treatment of Afghan Mujahideens. Having secret trips to Afghanistan to provide financial & Medical aid for the Mujaheedins, he worked a lot for the victory of Mujaheedins over Soviet troops. During the war against Soviet Invasion he formed strong ties with United Nations and then he founded several other NGOs like Mercy Corps International (MCI) for the agricultural development of Afghanistan, Demining Agency for Afghanistan (DAFA) and Rehabilitating Infrastructure for Rural Afghanistan (RIFRA) for the development of Afghanistan.Taliban Era.After the Soviet withdrawal he was proposed so many posts in the Afghan Mujaheedin\'s Government but he refused and continued with his task of reinstating the Former King of Afghanistan Mohammad Zahir Shah. He lived in exile in Quetta, in Pakistan where he worked to reinstate the previous king of Afghanistan, Zahir Shah. During exile in Quetta, Yousef Pashtun along with some other Prominent Afghan Political figures like Abdul Ahad Karzai(father of Hamid Karzai), Hamid Karzai, Gul Agha Sherzai and other figures worked to reinstate the former Afghan king. He has also worked in the executive committee of Loya Jirga under the command of His Excellency Mohammad Zahir Shah (The father of the Nation and former King of Afghanistan).After the Fall of Taliban.During U.S. Invasion over Taliban Government in 2001, Yousef Pashtun along with Gul Agha Sherzai and assistance from American special forces attacked the Southern Zone and captured Kandahar city within a week. When Gul Agha Sherzai was announced as Governor of Kandahar in January 2002, Pashtun was appointed as the Executive coordinator of Kandahar province to reinstate the local Government.Kandahar Governor.Karzai\'s government ruled that officials could not hold military and civil posts simultaneously, hence Hamid Karzai replaced Gul Agha Sherzai as the Governor of Kandahar and appointed Yousef Pashtun on 15 August 2003. Sherzai transferred the power peacefully as Pashtun was much close to him and they were from the same Barakzai tribe. Yousef Pashtun was seen as central government loyalist and more effective administrator, Afghan officials said. International Community was also interested to work with him for the rehabilitation of Kandahar as he was an experienced Urban plan with technical expertise. Yousef Pashtun tried to enhance the development projects in Kandahar which created more job opportunities for the locals, leading to the stabilization of the region. He was successful so far in his goals, to achieve development and peace in the province. As he was not known as a Tribal leader, but as an intellectual, hence he was able to unite the tribes efficiently. During his term, he reduced the poppy cultivation by 40% in the province. Yousef Pashtun created special unit for coordinating foreign aid to be channeled through one channel and spent on prioritized projects. He also worked on uniting the Governors of Southern Afghanistan (Kandahar, Helmand, Oruzgan, Zabul and Nimroz) to cooperate with each other. He worked on Kandahar city\'s new master plan, rehabilitation of city roads and upgrading the local Municipality System in the city.Minister of Urban Development.In 2002, he was appointed Minister of Urban Development and Housing under the Transitional Government, and a year later, was appointed Governor of Kandahar Province.

As a Minister of Urban Development, he established an Independent Board for the Development of Kabul New City. The Board brings together key stakeholders, including relevant government agencies, as well as urban specialists and economists. The board prepared a master plan for the city in the context of Greater Kabul. The master plan and its implementation strategy for 2025 were endorsed by the Afghan Cabinet in early 2009. Soon, as a top priority, the initiative turned into one of the biggest commercially viable national development project of the country, expected to be led by the private sector. During his term, he was able to complete the Strategic expansion plans for all major cities of Afghanistan which counts up to 20 cities.Minister Pashtun played the leading role in the rehabilitation of Current Parliament of Afghanistan.

This interview portrayed his image as a Politician who is much blunt and not involved in political deals in Afghanistan. Some political analysts highlights his transfer from Minister to Senior Adviser to President as a move to keep him more involved in this fight against land mafia. Unlike Cabinet minister who is answerable to both houses of Parliament, Vice Presidents and other Government authorities, as Adviser of President he can perform his job without any interruption from Members of Parliaments or any other political group. He is also known as one of the most influential Adviser to President Karzai, especially on technical issues.'),(3574725,'Bianca_Montgomery','Bianca Montgomery.Bianca Christine Montgomery is a fictional character from the American daytime drama All My Children. Until Eden Riegel assumed the role, portraying the character from July 2000 to January 2010, the character was portrayed solely by child actresses; Lacey Chabert, Nathalie Paulding, Gina Gallagher, Caroline Wilde and Jessica Leigh Falborn. When Riegel decided to permanently exit the role, plans to recast were confirmed; in June 2010, Christina Bennett Lind replaced Riegel, and remained on the series through the original television finale episode, which aired September 23, 2011. In February 2013, it was announced that Riegel would be reprising her role as Bianca in a guest-arc on Prospect Park\'s continuation of All My Children.Bianca is scripted as the daughter of Erica Kane and the late Travis Montgomery, born onscreen on February 8, 1988. Her birthday was revised to February 9, 1984 on January 31, 2002 by the show\'s producers, and her age was stated as 16 in 2000. The middle name given to the character is Christine, after her paternal aunt, Christine Montgomery, and she is portrayed as sweet-natured and well-loved in the fictional community of Pine Valley. Shown to suffer from Reye\'s syndrome in infancy, as well as anorexia nervosa later in life, she overcomes both with the significant aid of her family.Outside of fiction, Bianca has emerged as a gay icon within the LGBT community. Newspapers such as The New York Times cite her as the first lead character on a major daytime drama to be a lesbian, and The Advocate calls her themost famous gay soap role of all time. She has been the subject and study of various academic works, said to have inspired soap opera writers to begin with the scripting of sexual identities of tortured teen characters, and is a heroine. Under Riegel\'s portrayal, her popularity has been cited as groundbreaking.Casting and character creation.As a teenager, Eden Riegel nearly gave up on her pursuit of a successful acting career. She stated that she had seen a number of talented people who were struggling, and that she started to doubt whether she would ever have the success that she wanted. She decided that it was time to major in social and political theory, go to law school, and become a lawyer. This changed while she attended Harvard. While there, she received a call from a casting director who thought that the five-foot-six beauty should audition to become Erica Kanes daughter. Later, the character would eventually be revealed to be a lesbian. Producers did not tell Riegel she would be portraying a lesbian until after she won the role. I was surprised, she said.All My Children creator Agnes Nixon cites that scripting Bianca as a lesbian was in part inspired by Chastity Bono\'s memoir Family Outing. Nixon explained the feelings she wanted expressed with the character\'s mother, Erica. She wanted to showcase the thought process and actions most parents have upon finding out that their child is gay: I think the right word for Erica\'s reaction is denial, said Nixon. I read Family Outing by Chastity Bono. Cher had loads of friends who were gay, but she wasn\'t able to deal with [Chastity\'s being gay]. In this prejudicial society in which we live, the first reaction from a parent usually is, \'What did I do wrong?\'Nixon, well known for her socially relevant storylines, said that the makings for the Bianca story began in 1947; a college housemate came out to Nixon when Nixon was the same age Riegel had been in 2000. Nixon acknowledged that their original lesbian story in 1983, which lasted two months, did not work out as well as she had hoped and she felt it needed perfecting. Now, in a soap, if you want to do a story about a social issue seriously, the character has to be really well integrated. Bianca\'s story is the result of that  with growth and maturity, she stated.Riegel discussed Bianca\'s storyline with her sister, Tatiana. Tatiana, who is a lesbian and eighteen years Riegel\'s senior, became one of the primary people Riegel wanted to impress with the storyline. With Tatiana living in Los Angeles, where she works as a film editor and Riegel having lived on the East Coast most of her early life, the sisters did not grow up together but maintained a close relationship. Riegel took the role as an opportunity to bond with Tatiana over a character project, and said Tatiana was one of the people she was most concerned about in portraying Bianca\'s story.At the time of Bianca\'s character development upon Riegel taking over the role, there were strict instructions from the show\'s writers and producers not to reveal Bianca as gay to anyone outside the show (as the storyline had not played out on television screens yet). Despite this, Riegel informed Tatiana two months before the storyline finally began. The revelation was easily envisioned by the sisters as a storyline from a soap opera due to Riegel having told Tatiana Bianca\'s secret on the day of their father\'s third wedding. Tatiana said that Riegel was very excited about informing her of Bianca\'s sexual orientation and that she was happy for her sister. I just thought it was a kick that she would be playing a lesbian  specifically, Erica Kane\'s daughter! said Tatiana.Tatiana did have her concerns about the storyline. She did not want the show to do a gay stereotype. Riegel voiced the same concerns earlier on about the character; she clarified that she asked the show\'s writers and producers to make the character three-dimensional and not so heavily centered on the character\'s sexual orientation. Having grown up close to an out lesbian sister, who came out in her early 20s, Riegel was familiar with how Bianca should be if stereotypes were to be avoided. At the time of Tatiana\'s coming-out process, Riegel and brother Sam were children. Tatiana relayed that being gay was not an issue and that she could not remember having had a conversation with them about it at that age. By the time Riegel and Sam were old enough to know what being gay meant, they had grown to love Tatiana\'s girlfriend and the family was closer than before. Riegel having acquired the role of Bianca led her and Tatiana to discuss certain specifics of the character. Riegel\'s mindset was centered on what it must have been like for Tatiana to grow up as gay. She said that she had never heard Tatiana\'s whole coming-out story before and that it was nice to talk about.A year and a half after Bianca\'s coming out as a lesbian, Riegel and Tatiana felt that the show had done a great job in telling the story of a gay woman and her struggles.Characterization, story influence and recast.In a Variety magazine interview, Julie Hanan Carruthers, executive producer of the show, spoke of Bianca\'s character development. She gave insight into the heart of the story. It was so successful, she said. We did not tell a story about a lesbian. We told a story about a young girl coming out and her life around it. That was a big lesson to all of us here. It\'s really all about the story. If you can make people care on a human level, it\'s not sexual preference. It\'s about the human experience.The writers characterized Bianca\'s personality as kind-hearted but intolerant of nonsense. These traits were given to reflect the personalities of her parents and her late grandmother (Mona). Additionally, other characters in Bianca\'s family have been written as protective.Megan McTavish, the show\'s head writer at the time, said she was most astonished that fans elevated Bianca into one of the serial\'s \'tent poles\'  soap parlance for characters who hold enormous sway with viewers. McTavish explained that if a character is nice to Bianca, the audience tends to like that character, and if he is mean to Bianca, the audience knows he is a bad guy. It\'s stunning, she cited. The lesbian girl became the moral tent pole of our show.In a 2007 interview with TV Guide, former head writers of the series, James Harmon Brown and Barbara Esensten, stated that since Riegel\'s portrayal, the character is simply too iconic to ever recast. However, in 2010, Riegel decided to permanently exit the role, and plans to recast were subsequently confirmed. TV Guide\'s Nelson Branco said, Recasting a superstar is a very risky move, but [All My Children] is clearly determined to test fate.In a March 30, 2010 interview with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel explained why she decided to move on from the character: I had tried to make it work with All My Children. I dont have a business head, so I dont really make business decisions; every decision I make in my life is emotional and it was difficult to feel that the show wasnt... that Bianca was getting lost. That who she was, was getting lost. I went back several times and they were so lovely to let me come back and play a character I love with the people I love so many times. But I felt that the people making the show didnt really understand what Bianca was about anymore... It troubled me. I got letters from people to whom Bianca meant a great deal essentially saying, Please dont come back. We can\'t take it anymore.On May 13, 2010, it was reported that All My Children had found a recast for the character, after a long and careful search. Actress Christina Bennett Lind, cited as having an astonishing resemblance to Riegel, was cast. [Lind] oozes goodness and we really needed that for Bianca. [Lind] brought an integrity and honest innocence to the role that was very tough to match, stated Carruthers. We turned the earth [upside down] going through the candidates. When [Lind] came in to read for the part, she was Bianca. I think itll be a very easy transition for the audience.Although Riegel said it would be very painful to watch someone else portray Bianca, and that she would not want to watch, she later tweeted, [All My Children] gets a new Bianca and she\'s super pretty! And, of course, by that I mean she looks like me. I wish her the very best of luck, of course, and will be cheering her on along with the rest of the [All My Children] fans. Lind regarded this as a compliment, and was appreciative of the support.Lind said of assuming the role, The audition for Bianca felt like an amusement park ride. It was such a thrill to go to an audition by plane rather than subway! I can only hope I do half of what [Riegel] did with the part. She played it with amazing grace and dignity. Now I need to breathe my own life into it. Regarding Bianca being the moral center of Pine Valley and the pressure of being a recast, Lind said she did feel pressure in the beginning. I did look at some of [Riegel\'s] footage online to prep for it. She, for obvious reasons, was so beautiful, real, and honest in her portrayal of Bianca. Lind stated that it ultimately came down to her not wanting to mimic Riegel: Part of me feels very strongly that [Riegel] created a character that was so well-written, detailed, and complicated, and the element of being gay was part of who she was, but it did not define her. I sort of wanted to take that and breathe my own life into it and do something else by using myself rather than using someone elses interpretation. I understand these emotions and all humans do, of wanting to support your family and be equal and be in love. Ultimately, I said, I can feel the pressure, but I am going to let it go. The role is so full and rich that I thought, Well, now I am just going to throw myself into it.Lind said there was no trepidation in taking on a gay role, and that she is really proud to portray Bianca. I am surprised that the gay community is still struggling and fighting so many years later, she said. They are still fighting for basic human rights. I am excited to be a part of that fight. Regarding most of Pine Valley being okay with Bianca being gay, Lind stated that she is a little curious to see some sort of real-life conflict arrive and see that some people in her small town do not accept her sexuality. Lind clarified, In a sense, that is pretty relevant and controversial and true. Because Pine Valley is the exception, its a beautiful utopia right now. I wouldnt mind attacking those issues that are happening in small towns right now.Storyline.As a child, Bianca originally appears on a recurring basis on All My Children. She was born on-screen in 1988, the out-of-wedlock daughter of Erica Kane and Travis Montgomery. Erica and Travis later wed, but the marriage soon collapses after Travis helps stage a fake kidnapping of Bianca in order to prevent Adam Chandler from taking over his company. Two years later, as Bianca is recovering from Reye\'s syndrome, Erica and Travis remarry for their daughter\'s sake. However, by that time Erica is having a secret affair with Travis\' brother Jackson, and as soon as Bianca catches them kissing, she sets her Uncle Jack doll on fire and ends up burning the house down. After that incident, Travis divorces Erica, wins full custody of Bianca, moves to Seattle, and remarries his ex-wife, Barbara.Although Bianca is living with her father, she visits her mother from time to time. In 1993, Kendall Hart arrives, Erica\'s first-born daughter Erica gave birth to at age 14 and gave up for adoption to the Harts, a couple from Florida, after becoming pregnant when she was raped on her 14th birthday by movie actor Richard Fields. A now 9- to 10-year-old Bianca becomes a target of her older half-sister\'s jealousy when Kendall\'s identity is revealed and she is reunited with Erica. Kendall, hurt she was given up for adoption, believes Bianca (in Kendall\'s view) had the life she should have always had too while Bianca is upset that she is not Erica\'s only daughter. Though she, Erica, Kendall, and her new stepfather, Dimitri, try to make their family work, Bianca and Kendall often bicker with each other, competing for Erica\'s attention. Bianca ruins Kendall\'s bridesmaid\'s dress and Kendall manipulates Bianca, ignoring her sister\'s cries when she later hears them from the Wildwind crypt after Bianca accidentally locks herself inside. In 1994, when Bianca looks for Kendall at a motel, Richard Fields finds her and attempts to molest her. However, Kendall stops him and saves Bianca from Fields before any assault occurs.In August 1994, Bianca comes to Pine Valley again following the death of Mona Kane Tyler, so overwhelmed by her loss and furious that she did not get to spend much time with her grandmother. Later, Bianca is kidnapped by Dr. Jonathan Kinder and held her for ransom. Kinder is Erica\'s doctor and has her hooked on painkillers. In self-defense, Bianca pushes Kinder down his stairs. Erica thinks he is dead, and so with help from Janet Green and Skye Chandler, they bury Kinder, but he is very much alive.After Erica is arrested in 1997 for kidnapping Madelyn Grey, the daughter of Edmund Grey and Maria Santos, Bianca runs away from Travis and Barbara to be with her mother. Travis and Barbara then arrive to take Bianca home, but after Travis tells them that Erica would never see Bianca again, Bianca faints and is rushed to the hospital. Bianca is diagnosed with anorexia nervosa and by 1998 ends up hospitalized with a feeding tube. She then goes to a New England rehabilitation center to recover.Sixteen-year-old Bianca (her birth date now revised by the series) returns home in 2000, stunning her mother, Erica, by confessing that she is in a lesbian relationship with a girl named Sarah. Erica is unable to accept this, but Bianca does find support from Leo du Pres, who often counsels her on life matters. This earns her some jealousy from Greenlee Smythe, who tauntingly calls her LesBianca, but she and Bianca later become friends. This stemmed from Greenlee taking Bianca to see her daughter\'s supposed memorial, and she gave her a necklace that Leo had given her, and she passed on to her.Sarah\'s family also disapproves, and to appease them she gets engaged to a man, despite still loving Bianca. Bianca\'s second girlfriend, Frankie Stone, comes to Pine Valley as part of her aunt Vanessa Cortlandt\'s ploy to distract Bianca. Frankie develops true feelings for Bianca, but is then murdered by one of Vanessa\'s henchmen. Soon after, Frankie\'s identical twin sister, Maggie, arrives and becomes friends with Bianca, often defending her when she is bullied by homophobic classmates. Despite Maggie professing to being heterosexual, she shows a romantic interest in Bianca, which is reciprocated; however, their relationship does not progress past friendship and Bianca begins dating another woman, Polish-born Lena Kundera. Bianca works with Lena at Erica\'s company, Enchantment Cosmetics. They fall in love, and share a chaste kiss in 2003 while at an airport. Though the relationship is tested when Bianca discovers Michael Cambias, owner of a rival cosmetics firm, has employed Lena to spy on Enchantment Cosmetics, they remain together.In July 2003, Bianca is raped by Michael. She internalizes her rage and only tells Maggie, but eventually the entire town of Pine Valley learns the truth, which brings Bianca and her estranged mother closer. Michael is charged with rape but, to the town\'s outrage, he is acquitted. When Bianca discovers she is pregnant as a result of rape, Kendall, who had so often scorned Bianca in their past, unconditionally supports her sister and does not give an opinion on Bianca\'s choices. Michael disappears and Kendall announces she has married her sister\'s rapist, who shortly turns up dead with Kendall having become the primary suspect in his murder. When Bianca tells Kendall she is keeping her baby, also inspired by Kendall being part of her life, Kendall helps her sister and, with Maggie and Lena\'s help, aids her in hiding her pregnancy from everyone, including Erica. Kendall announces she is pregnant by Michael, which is also used by her lawyers to help avoid a murder charge and Bianca helps Kendall fake the pregnancy. Bianca and Kendall\'s ruse is aided by Dr. David Hayward, Ryan Lavery, Lena, Maggie, Reggie Montgomery, and Jackson. The truth eventually comes out that Bianca is the killer but blocked it out and that Kendall, with Reggie\'s help, worked to cover it up in an effort to protect Bianca; Bianca shot Michael in self-defense but the trauma of her rape led to her repressing the memory. After hearing Bianca\'s confession, the judge presiding over the case leans hard on the prosecution not to file any charges against her.While Erica tries to protect her daughters throughout the trial, she lashes out at them for keeping the truth from her. Bianca gives birth to a daughter named Miranda in 2004, at a cabin which Bianca and Babe became stranded at during a thunderstorm. After a difficult birth for Bianca, Babe Carey goes to get help and ends up going into labor herself. Babe gives birth to a son with the help of her former husband Paul Cramer, whom she had called for help. During the commotion, Paul secretly kidnaps Babe\'s son and gives her Miranda instead, whilst claiming to Bianca that her daughter perished in a helicopter crash, which he had staged. Miranda is renamed Bess. Bianca grieves for her lost child, and even tries to kidnap Bess, not realizing she is her actual daughter. As she mourns, Bianca and Kendall become close with their mother again. When Bianca discovers the truth, she attempts to reclaim her daughter, but falls from a balcony during a scuffle with Miranda\'s acting father, JR Chandler, and ends up comatose. Miranda is later returned to Bianca, causing her to awake from her coma. Bianca never remembers how she fell, whether or not JR pushed her, but she holds him responsible for her fall. In addition, Bianca cannot forgive Babe, who had previously discovered Miranda/Bess\'s true maternity, but could not part with the child.Bianca\'s relationship with Lena ends when Lena returns to Poland, and her relationship with Maggie subsequently becomes an issue again, as Bianca realizes that she is still in love with her. Maggie, however, is romantically involved with Jonathan Lavery. After Bianca helps free Maggie from this abusive relationship, they begin to bond again. Though the nature of Bianca and Maggie\'s relationship is not specified, they, along with Miranda, relocate to Paris in 2005. While there, Bianca heads up the international division of Cambias Industries, which Enchantment now owns. Bianca and Maggie become lovers and are happy together, but in 2007, Bianca returns to Pine Valley alone. She states Maggie has cheated on her with another woman. Maggie follows her, hoping for reconciliation, but despite loving her, Bianca declines.Family problems resurface due to Bianca\'s sexuality, but this time from her conservative former stepmother Barbara, who denounces her lifestyle, but eventually sees the error of her ways. Bianca rebuilds her friendship with Babe upon finding out that Babe, who was pronounced dead as a result of a serial killer\'s killing spree, is alive. She then reciprocates the romantic feelings Zarf (later known as Zoe), a transgender lesbian rock star, has for her. Zoe later tells her that at this point in her transition process, a romantic relationship between them would not be best; Zoe is not ready for it, and instead moves to London. Bianca decides to move to Paris to be closer to Zoe, but returns on December 26, 2007 for a brief visit, cheering her family up following their recent traumas. Bianca reveals that she and Zoe drifted apart, but she is determined to provide a stable family unit for Miranda. After bidding farewell, she departs again on December 28, 2007.On October 17, 2008, Zach Slater is in the process of looking for wife Kendall buried under rubble due to a tornado having just struck Pine Valley. He finds Bianca instead, and is surprised to see that she is pregnant. He later finds an unconscious Kendall. As an ambulance arrives for her, it is stated that there is not enough room for Bianca and Zach to ride along to the hospital. There is, however, enough room for Zach and Kendall\'s children to ride in the front seat of the ambulance. Zach and Bianca stay behind and discuss Kendall\'s fate. They also discuss Bianca\'s secret that she is pregnant with Zach\'s child via sperm donation, and Bianca\'s new lover named Reese. Zach had agreed to father Bianca\'s child for the couple, but did not know that she had gone through with the procedure of artificial insemination, until now. The two wonder how Kendall, who is unaware of this pregnancy, will react to the news when they tell her. As Zach and Bianca continue to talk, Bianca goes into labor. Zach helps deliver the new child into the world. Sometime later at the hospital, she is horrified to discover that Babe has perished in the disaster\'s aftermath. Reese Williams comes to Pine Valley, not long after the tornado with Miranda. She proposes marriage to Bianca and she accepts. Reese and Bianca have their share of obstacles to overcome as a couple, mainly Bianca\'s suspicions of Reese\'s sexuality and friendship with Zach, but they exchange wedding vows on February 13, 2009.Reese and Bianca\'s marriage does not last long when Bianca discovers that Reese engaged in a passionate kiss with Zach the day before their wedding. She later sends Reese annulment papers, and returns to Paris with Miranda and Gabrielle. However, she comes back to Pine Valley on April 24, 2009 after having discussed with Zach the reasons she left. After later talking over her and Reese\'s relationship problems with Zach and Kendall, the couple reconcile and hope that they can work their relationship out. They return to Paris together with their children, and later remarry.Bianca returns to Pine Valley to help search for Erica in June 2010, and eventually decides to stay. After Erica is found by Jackson Montgomery, Jack has Miranda and Gabrielle flown to Pine Valley. Currently, Miranda, Gabrielle, and Bianca are living at Wildwind with Caleb Cooney. After Reese decides that she is not coming back to Pine Valley, Bianca reluctantly decides to get a divorce, hiring Marissa Tasker for this end.Marissa warns Bianca that Reese may fight to gain custody of her kids and things may get ugly, but Bianca dismisses her concerns, convinced that she and Reese can end things civilly and that Marissa is merely letting her experience with JR get in the way. However, when Reese sends her lawyer and nanny to Pine Valley in her place with tickets for Miranda and Gabrielle to come back for spring break, Bianca realizes that Marissa\'s fears may not be completely unfounded. However, Marissa manages to get Jack and Erica to come to Bianca\'s aid, where Jack forces them to back off and leave. Bianca thanks Marissa and apologizes for doubting her. Bianca is subjected to even further turmoil when she discovers that Reese is indeed trying to obtain full custody of both Miranda and Gabby.On May 26, Bianca discovers that Ricky Torres, a seemingly friendly reverend, is in fact a criminal and the murderer of Zach. Realizing that she is on to him, Ricky assaults her. In the midst of the assault, Bianca remembers getting raped by Michael Cambias and suffers a panic attack. When Marissa comes along and sees Ricky carrying an unconscious Bianca, Ricky knocks her out, ties them up, and locks them in the closet. Upon regaining consciousness, Bianca reveals Ricky\'s true nature to Marissa, and they manage to escape. Bianca subsequently realizes that she is developing romantic feelings for Marissa.Because of these romantic feelings, Bianca helps JR win Marissa back by suggesting romantic dates and gifts that he can give to Marissa. Bianca does all this because she realizes that Marissa may never reciprocate the same feelings for her. One of the gifts that Bianca gives to JR for Marissa is a music box. This music box plays a song that Marissa\'s adoptive father used to sing to her when she was a little girl. JR gives the music box to Marissa while at the park with the kids. While Marissa is listening to the music box, Bianca watches from afar how much Marissa enjoys the gift and walks away.On June 24, while on a trip with the kids, Bianca finally confesses her feelings to Marissa. Marissa, surprised, says that she is flattered and loves Bianca, just not in that way. Marissa apologizes and says she is straight. Bianca feels relieved that she got her feelings out in the open and she can now move on. Marissa, now feeling uncomfortable, leaves the trip early for JR\'s birthday. Marissa, after she slept with JR, thinks about Bianca.When Marissa finds out about Bianca helping JR with trying to win her back, she asks Bianca about. Bianca tells Marissa she did it because Bianca could not do all those things for Marissa herself. Another reason was because it looked like Marissa was falling in love with JR again and because it seemed like JR had changed. Marissa accuses Bianca of manipulating her and the situation. Bianca suggests that they should not see each other for a while and Marissa agrees.On July 12, Marissa finally admits her feelings for Bianca and they kiss. Bianca then pulls away during the kiss, saying that she can\'t do this and that this is a mistake. Bianca then explains that all her relationships have been a dead end  that, in the end, she ends up losing her lover and best friend. However, later on, Bianca walks in as Marissa tells JR that she wants Bianca. Marissa then confesses to both Bianca and JR that she is in love with Bianca. In the following weeks, Bianca and Marissa start dating, much to JR\'s fury, and discuss moving in together.On September 23, Marissa and Bianca received a text message that they believed was from Scott who invited them to a party at the Chandler mansion to celebrate the resurrection of Stuart Chandler who had been presumed dead for two years until he was revealed to be alive as a part of Project Orpheus. They attended the party and enjoyed celebrating life in Pine Valley when JR, in a drunken rage, shot into the crowd. It is revealed on May 2, 2013 that Marissa died and that she was the one who JR shot. Marissa\'s father, David, tried to stop JR from pulling the trigger, but the gun misfired. David then threw JR to the floor and shot him and as a result, JR lapsed into a five-year-long coma. David was arrested and jailed for the incident but later returned to Pine Valley after being paroled. Bianca is seen visiting Marissa\'s grave and updating Marissa on her son AJ and Miranda, whom they had planned to raise together. Bianca tells Marissa that they were supposed to be together and that she will never stop missing her. After JR awakens from his coma, Bianca becomes upset when she sees him, going into a fit of grief and attacking him for killing Marissa. Bianca leaves Pine Valley telling everyone she is going away for work, but she is shown visiting her sister Kendall, who appears to be ill.Popularity.Bianca has been popular with critics and fans. Her romantic pairing with Lena Kundera resulted in American daytime\'s first lesbian kiss, which received substantial media attention. The following year, in 2004, Riegel appeared on the cover of Girlfriends, North Americas only lesbian monthly magazine; the content within the piece discussed Riegel\'s titled breakthrough lesbian role.Riegel\'s portrayal of the character incited mania, admiration, and viewers displaying overprotectiveness for the character. Riegel additionally won praise from leading gay groups for her complex portrayal of Bianca.Daytime and visibility.Bianca\'s impact on daytime television is considered significant for various reasons: She is cited as a gay icon by soap opera and gay/lesbian media, and is credited as the first long-term lesbian character on an American soap opera. AfterElton.com, a website that focuses on the portrayal of gay men in the media, addressed Bianca\'s impact on viewers. They noted All My Children creator Agnes Nixon having told The Advocate in 2000 that out-lesbian Chastity Bono\'s memoir was the inspiration for the Bianca storyline, and that she hoped that outing an already-established character as gay would make for a more integrated storyline. AfterElton.com said the representation of gay and lesbian characters in the media is important when taking into account that the viewing audience for soap operas is enormous. Cited was The Museum of Broadcast Communications\' assertion that soap opera is the most effective and enduring broadcast advertising vehicle ever devised. It is also the most popular genre of television drama in the world today and probably in the history of world broadcasting... The museum states that no other form of television fiction has attracted more viewers in more countries over a longer period of time. Author C. Lee Harrington, in her book Homosexuality on All My Children: Transforming the Daytime Landscape, stated that when resident villainess Greenlee Smythe uttered Bianca is gay during Bianca\'s coming-out storyline, it transformed the daytime landscape and ABC\'s All My Children entered uncharted territory for daytime television by revealing a core character as a lesbian.Jeffrey Epstein, at the time a staff writer for Soap Opera News, was criticized by AfterElton.com for his statement in 1998, where he discouraged the idea that there would be more gay or lesbian representation to come on daytime television due to soap operas being mostly viewed by women and that gay or lesbian romances do not truly enrich most heterosexual women\'s fantasies. AfterElton.com relayed that the viewing demographic for soap operas continues to grow and diversify, further clarifying, The popularity of the Bianca storyline on All My Children was proof that audiences were more than ready for a lesbian relationship, and his assessment of women\'s romantic fantasies in regards to gay male characters may prove to be equally outdated.Lesbianation.com, self-proclaimed as the leading online community for lesbians, voted Riegel #7 on their top ten list of Women We Love: The Ladies of June \'06, stating, We were swamped with requests to add All My Children hottie Eden Riegel to our list this month  and here she is!Bianca\'s popularity extended to her romances, as well as to other perceived possibilities; this was evident through the character\'s relationships with Maggie Stone, Lena Kundera, and Babe Carey. The relationship with Carey was not romantic, as Babe (now deceased within the series) was characterized as heterosexual; however, fans speculated that Bianca was secretly in love with Babe. This speculation was mainly due to Bianca\'s nonchalant and forgiving attitude regarding most of Babe\'s misdeeds. AfterEllen.com took notice and acknowledged that there were viewers hoping for a Bianca and Babe romance.Give Bianca her baby back.In 2004, with Bianca\'s rape having left her subsequently pregnant with Michael\'s child, and the baby switch storyline having robbed her of her daughter, viewers were infuriated by what they felt was the pain the character had endured within the year. They additionally found the Bianca and Babe friendship unappealing, specifically due to Babe knowingly keeping Bianca from her own child. Within the story, Babe is initially unaware that her child has been switched with Bianca\'s and that Bianca\'s child, the one she is caring for, is still alive and not dead as she had been led to believe. However, once convinced by Krystal to keep Bianca\'s child as her own in order to save JR from heartbreak, she does as advised. Due to her guilt, she goes as far as to name Bianca godmother of the child. Angered by these events, viewers campaigned for Bianca to discover the truth. The amount of mail sent to the ABC studios requesting and demanding that Bianca\'s baby be returned to her was cited as astounding for a fictional character, especially one of daytime  and who is also gay: Bianca\'s sexuality did not seem to matter to the thousands of fans who wrote letters, e-mail messages, and blog entries insisting that the only safe place for the baby was back in the arms of Pine Valley\'s one known lesbian.Described as Babe\'s long-overdue confessional and beginning of redemption, she confesses to Bianca the truth about their children on December 7, 2004. The culmination of this storyline combined with everything Bianca faces up to this point transform[s] Bianca into a courageous soap heroine who ha[s] fans rooting for her. Viewers became even more invested in her trials and tribulations and hopeful for the character finding romance. Brian Frons, president of ABC Daytime, stated:To have someone like Bianca who is openly gay, a mother, proud of who she is, who has fallen in love with another woman, who is taking heroic action  to have the audience embrace this character fully is pretty incredible. The audience went from \'I don\'t want to see a lesbian relationship\' to saying, \'Bianca should be in love.\'Havins and Riegel described what went into taping the moment Bianca discovers that her child is alive and Babe\'s deception. It was crazy!, said Riegel of the grueling day. It was insane, in fact. [Havins] and I were on the set from 9 a.m. to like 7:30 at night, just the two of us. Havins agreed and relayed, It was so intense to tape. It was a long, long day, a 12-hour tape day. They were warned by All My Children executives that the episode would be especially demanding. I don\'t think they\'ve ever handed that much material to just two actresses before, so they wanted us to be prepared, said Riegel. It was the most dialogue I\'ve ever had in my entire life. To the point where several weeks before they gave me the script, our producer, <a href=Julie_Hanan_Carruthers>a></a>, sat us down and said to us, \'This is just so important.,\' added Havins. And she turned to me and said, \'We\'re almost nervous because it\'s so much material. If it\'s too much, let us know.\' It was that dialogue-heavy.Riegel found humor in the situation and said, Unfortunately, we only got the script like three days ahead of time! But hey! We\'re old pros. When asked if they were intimidated by the challenge of the reveal scenes, Riegel asserted that she wasn\'t scared at all, and clarified that it was a good challenge and one of those things where it\'s like, \'This is what I do. This is what I love.\' She said, To have all that material and to be there in the moment... I didn\'t want to be in any other place. She found it exciting. Having waited for the moment for a long time, it turned out to be a big pay-off. She added: But I was a little nervous because this was definitely a very, very special episode. That was the biggest challenge to me; I was going in there knowing, \'This is the moment.\' I kept having to make myself laugh and leave set and play with my friends in the hair and makeup room and just sort of try to view the day as though it was just an average taping day because the last thing those scenes needed from my character\'s perspective was that sense of gravity, that feeling of, \'This is so important.\' Because it was not a big deal for my character  she had no idea what was coming.Havins agreed with Riegel that the reveal scenes were exciting. I\'m always up for a challenge and I work best under pressure, she said. My competitive side kicks in. So the thought that I maybe couldn\'t do it made me be like, \'Oh, yeah, I\'m doin\' it!\' We put so much preparation into it. Justin Bruening (Jamie Martin) and Jacob Young (JR) were the only other cast members in the episode. ...I worked with a private coach, we worked on it together... We put a lot of time into this episode, Havins stated. We usually don\'t have that luxury, but this time we did; this took priority. And shooting it, too, we knew it was a big deal. She revealed that the producers and director were patient with them. And if we felt we didn\'t like where a take went, usually they\'re like, \'No, it\'s fine, let\'s move on,\' but this time they were like, \'Let\'s do it again. We loved that take, girls, but let\'s try something else,\' and we\'d go in a totally different direction. She said, They took the time and they were as invested in this episode as [Riegel] and I were, so that was a really good feeling. We were all there, we were all in it together, and hopefully, the finished product shows it.In 2005, Riegel won an Emmy for the role. When she decided to leave the show that same year to pursue other acting ventures, it was suggested that the gay community would be losing a viable voice.Coming out.Scripting legendary character Erica as having a gay daughter initially upset a significant portion of the audience. Viewers were deeply attached to the character as the 16-year-old daughter of [the leading soap opera diva]. ABC held a series of focus groups to gauge audience reaction. Female viewers in Boston and some in Atlanta found the storyline refreshing and reflective of what they called the real world and its diversity. The Atlanta group, however, had a good portion who were concerned about morality and did not want a major character saddled with a lifelong problem. Boston viewers felt Bianca\'s problem was being in the closet; Atlantans voiced her problem was her sexual preference itself. In addition, there was opposition to the increased love for the character. Critics of gay marriage complained about a sympathetic gay heroine, saying Bianca made daytime television even more licentious.Rape debate.Bianca\'s rape was heavily debated; viewers who despised the storyline argued the rape as punishment for her sexuality, and as unnecessary; others felt that it realistically captured what gay women sometimes face from men who want to force themselves on lesbians. When GLAAD (Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) was asked by Metro Weekly why GLAAD sent out an action alert voicing their concern over the rape of Bianca, but two days later sent out another release which seemed to support how the storyline was told, Joan M. Garry, executive director of the organization, responded that they had some concerns about [the storyline] and that the broader context of the [daytime television] genre kind of needs to be taken into account. Metro Weekly felt that this did not answer their question. They wanted to know why there was a sudden reversal in GLAAD\'s statement, specifically citing that GLAAD\'s second press release spoke of rape experience for lesbians and how men who rape lesbians not only engage in gender based acts of violence, but in acts of hate violence, and that this release was supportive of how Bianca\'s rape storyline was told, as opposed to GLAAD\'s first press release on the matter. Garry said she felt that their first press release concerning Bianca\'s rape was premature. Metro Weekly countered by asking what is the actual process GLAAD uses to select what to criticize, what raises their organization\'s red flags. There\'s a whole host of input we receive about things as we hear about them, as we see them in script form, as we see them in pilots, Garry relayed. We have a strong team of program folks who represent different regions around the country, different communities. We get an awful lot of stuff that comes across the transom via our website raising concerns. And we did get quite a number of concerns coming over email, particularly about All My Children. Garry continued, So it\'s basically community feedback, as well as some of our own observations and perceptions. Combine that with conversations that we have with folks that are actually producing the images and we really try to work our way through those different opinions and shape a position we think makes sense.In an interview with Soap Opera Digest, Riegel detailed what it was like preparing for her character\'s rape scenes. She explained that it was grueling and that there were only four people in the episode. She found it to be very work-intensive, emotionally haunting, and voiced that she had trouble sleeping. She elaborated that these type of scenes really stay with a person. Riegel and co-star William deVry (Michael Cambias) rehearsed the scenes on their own, which normally would not have been the case. Riegel commented that it definitely required more work than an ordinary episode. Asked if she was frightened of deVry during Bianca\'s rape scenes, she admitted that she was and that it was a testament to deVry\'s acting skills. About the uneasiness of the scenes and whether or not she was frightened or intimidated by the gravity of the storyline, she stated, Absolutely, I was. To be honest, I didn\'t know if I could handle it. But I knew it was a very important thing to do and that the show was serious about handling it well. She added, I knew we could reach people, and that it was powerful stuff. I could feel the power of it. And I knew I should put myself through this because ultimately it might help somebody, touch somebody, make people talk about it. And rape is something people should talk about.Transgender romance.Bianca\'s romantic attraction to transgender rockstar Zoe was met with criticism from the gay and lesbian community, and fans in general. They asserted that, as a lesbian, it is illogical for Bianca to be intensely romantically attracted to a transgender woman who is still of the male form, and that even more stressing was that the show conveyed the story as soul-love (the belief that sexual orientation can be negated if you simply love that person\'s soul). Viewers titled the couple Barf (for Bianca and Zarf), and TV Guide, which reported the nickname, named the storyline one of the worst of 2007.The San Francisco Bay Area Reporter, Inc., a free weekly newspaper serving the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) communities in the area, were one of the first to comment on their discontent with the matter:We have repeatedly voiced our displeasure over the transgender/lesbian storyline between Zarf/Zoe and Bianca. We disagree with the basic premise, Zarf/Zoe as a MTF transgendered lesbian. We want Bianca to be with a woman (and she did have a one-night stand with Leslie on New Years Eve, which has to be a first for a daytime soap). We dont want her already messy love life in which she has never been allowed to have a fully realized relationship with another woman (her first lover went crazy and was institutionalized, her next was killed, the next was a corporate thief who then had to return to Poland, the next identical twin of the one who was killed wasnt sure she was even queer and then left her for another woman). We dont want her life complicated with the complexities of a transgender relationship.The Wow Report delivered a scathing remark when they referred to Zarf as a drag queen and commented on their disbelief that All My Children was winning GLAAD awards.Gabrielle Montgomery.In October 2008, with Bianca\'s return to the series during a series of tornadoes striking fictional town Pine Valley, Bianca was reported to be pregnant with her second child. Fans immediately began speculating on who the sperm donor was, which caught the attention of soap opera press, LGBT press, and other media outlets. TV Guide reported that nobody knows [Bianca\'s] in town until her brother-in-law finds her under the rubble. SOAPnet.com stated, The physical affects [sic] of the tornado are miniscule [sic] compared to the ripples Biancas presence creates. Another soap opera website sensationalized the story by stating, When Bianca returns to town this time, she will have a brand new someone special in her life and a big surprise  Bianca is pregnant! And wait until everyone finds out who the \'father\' is.Fans, aware that Miranda Montgomery, Bianca\'s first child, who was the result of rapist Michael Cambias, speculated Zach Slater as the child\'s biological father; Zach was Michael\'s older brother. Fans theorized that Bianca wanted a baby closely related to Miranda and asked Zach to father the child. If Bianca were already pregnant when she got to Pine Valley, then Zach could have donated last time Bianca was in town, even though the timing within the series was off.Another theory concluded Biancas former love Zarf/Zoe as the father; the argument arose over a website putting father in quotations. The father is really a mother trapped in a fathers body, went the theory.Zach was eventually confirmed as the father of the child by magazine Soap Opera Digest, and Bianca\'s reasons for asking Zach to be the donor and doing so without informing her sister and Zach\'s wife, Kendall Hart Slater, infuriated viewers. They reasoned that neither Bianca nor Zach would do this to Kendall.The child was soon named Gabrielle Montgomery, and the choice for Zach as the father made Miranda and the new child not only half-sisters, but cousins as well, which some viewers found icky.');

Though the municipality of Ribadesella was initially proposed, Colunga was chosen for the building site in the late 1990s. Several landmarks are visible from the museum including the Bay of Biscay, the Sierra del Sueve, and the Picos de Europa. Strategically located over a mount on the Rasa de San Temo, the museum is in the midst the Jurassic Asturias.The museum displays and collections cover 3,500 million years, and although they emphasize the three stages of the Mesozoic (Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous), information is also presented on the preceding and subsequent periods. Different stages of the Jurassic geologic period and system are on display. Corridors contain over 20 dinosaur replicas; measuring over in height, their weight would exceed ten tons if the replicas were real. A rich collection of footprints and fossils found in the Asturian Jurassic coastline from ten paleontological sites are exhibited in the exposition halls and are said to be the most complete informative and representative collection of dinosaur remains in the world.Founded March 31, 2004 and representing an investment of 12 million euros, MUJA belongs to the Asturian network of public museums. The museum\'s goal is to illustrate the factors involved in the composition of life on Earth. The palaeontologist Jos Carlos Garca-Ramos from the University of Oviedo leads the museum\'s scientific team.Geography.The museum is located close to the coastline of the Cantabrian Sea and Llastres, a fishing port.

MUJA is on the branch road AS-257 towards Llastres, about 1.5km away.During a visit to the cliffs of the coastline between Gijn and Ribadesella in the councils of Villaviciosa, Colunga and Ribadesella of Asturias, which is called the Coast of Dinosaurs, dinosaur ichnite deposits were found to be in abundance. Jurassic reptile footprints and bone were unearthed during excavations that started in 2005. Fossils found during these excavations are on display in the museum.Architecture.The museum, which opened in 2004, was designed by the architect, Rufino Uribelarrea. The building has many special features, particularly the roof, which is in the form of a fingerprint counter mould kittiwake, feature of the dinosaurs. The building itself is shaped in the form of a giant tridactyl dinosaur footprint. Three ellipsoidal vaults intersect to form the deck space which is a large, open area of. The roof structure is made entirely of laminated wood, a plywood. The entire roof is covered with a copper skin plate, which has been described by the European Association for the Development of Architectural Copper as that it gradually oxidises to dark brown colour, and then, after several years, the typical green patina of aged copper protects the building and its contents for decades, even in the aggressive marine environment.The first floor, ground floor and basement of the building are. Three wide vaults or rooms extend to the ceiling and are divided by the Mesozoic divisions of Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Triassic. The basement houses over 400 tons of fossils that have yet to be classified. The first floor has a temporary exhibition room, a reception room, administration room, and workshops, as well as a library and a laboratory. The ground floor contains a display hall, an audio-visual room and the permanent exposition room, along with an auditorium. The service areas include a store, gardens, cafeteria, and playgrounds.Collection.MUJA\'s main collection centres around 8,000 fossils from Asturias\' Jurassic period. Divided into four sections, one contains 150 traces from the coast; another has 200 fossils of dinosaurs, crocodiles, fish, and tortoises; the third has 103 vegetable fossils and eleven tree trunk fragments; and the last has approximately 6,000 invertebrate fossils.A module explains the geological history of Asturias, focusing on the Jurassic Coast and the marine levels that formed the city of Gijn. Some of the replicas include a couple of copulating Tyrannosaurus rex, as well as an Argentine Giganotosaurus, one of the largest known carnivorous dinosaurs. A large-clawed Deinonychus is also featured. Quintueles, Oles, and Tazones specimens are housed at the MUJA.The largest of the finds from the Coast of Dinosaurs are: the footprint of a theropod dinosaur of length, the smallest ichnites of sauropod dinosaurs of about length. Collections in the museum from the coastal finds also include 255 specimens of dinosaur ichnites. Martin Lockley, Palaeontologist of the University of Colorado Denver states that the collection of ichnites of the MUJA represents one of the most complete worldwide.The collection of vertebrates of the Jurassic period is unique. Some of the specimens on display in the museum are an incomplete skeleton of a marine crocodile, a piece of the jaw of a small ichthyosaur, a long specimen of ulna (equivalent to the cubitus bone) of a brachiosaurid, the partial skeleton of a stegosaur, several bones of plesiosaurs, bone remnants of sea turtles (including several shells), and also specimens of several partial fish. Also on display are Jurassic period fossil plants.In the Triassic hall, there are exhibits of dinosaurs as they first appeared in the Triassic period, 251 to 200 million years ago. The recreated and easily identifiable dinosaurs on display here have bones and footprints or ichnites. Also shown are the gastroliths (stones gulped down by some dinosaurs to crush food in their stomachs), coprolites (fossilized dung), eggs and nests. The Plateosaurus dinosaur is the largest on display here.The Jurassic period, representing the intermediate period of the Mesozoic from 200 and 145 million years ago, considered the grandeur period of the dinosaurs, is represented in the Jurassic hall, which has large sauropods. The display has a unique representation through a cladogram which defines the features of the major groups of the period. Information on display relates to the anatomical features such as weight, neck bonding, arm musculature, circulatory system and the relative size of the skull.The theropods aggressive aspects are shown in the form of their teeth and claws. Ornithopods, which are vegetarian by habit are shown with snouts, tooth batteries, mobile skull bones jowls and with hoped feet. Thyreophorans exhibits depict their defensive anatomical features against predators in the form of bone shields, spikes, tail clubs and so forth. Camarasaurus, a large-sized sauropod dinosaur, found in central and western United States are exhibited in their original curved form. The exposition part dedicated to ornithopods is centred on the morphological characteristics most related to their vegetarian diet namely toothless snout, tooth batteries, mobile skull bones, and development of jowls and presence of hoofs on their feet. The space dedicated to thyreophorans shows the main defensive elements of this group of dinosaurs against predators such as bone shields, spikes, tail clubs and so forth. Marine Jurassic vertebrates are exhibited in the central hall alongside large reptiles such as ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs, crocodiles and fish. The skeletons of an ichthyosaur, a fish-shaped reptile akin to a dolphin, and of a sea lily or crinoid are also on display in separate cabinets.In the Pre-Mesozoic hall, the exhibits relate to the time from the creation of the Earth 4500 million years ago to the Palaeozoic age, 251 million years ago with displays of first organisms on the Earth, evolution process of fossils and their dating, classification of the vertebrates and their inherited relations, deterioration and extinction of nearly 95% of these systems by end of the Palaeozoic period.In the hall representing the Cretaceous period, which is the last period of the Mesozoic era from 145 to 66 million years ago, the displays relate to the biological and social habits of dinosaurs, reasons for their extinction by the end of the Cretaceous period, that are attributed to meteorite, volcanic eruptions and intense geographic and climatic changes. Evolution of birds inferred as theropods evolving from the non-avian dinosaurs are represented by the Archaeopteryx (a prehistoric bird) and dinosaurs such as the Deinonychus or the Dromaeosaurus.Post-Mesozoic, representing the last 66 million years, starting with the extinction of a major part of the dinosaurs, is the Tertiary period when reptile, mammals and modern faunas evolved in that order. The Cantabrotherium truyolsi represents the deposit of Llamaquique, in Oviedo. A touch screen display provides a complete history of the last 66 million years of the evolution of the landscape and the ecosystems. The replica of a skull, No. 5, dated to 300,000 years, is an exhibit in the hall of the Quaternary period. Displays in this hall also cover the decline of the brown bear habitat in the north of the Iberian Peninsula over 500 years and the skull of a cave bear.In the basement of the museum, there is a hall where temporary exhibitions are held on different themes. Past shows were on the themes of Asturias, Natural Paradise, the Great Adventure of Dinosaurs, European Rupestrian art, the Coast of Dinosaurs, Trapped in Ice, Jurassic Colossus and 2010 Biodiversity.Publications.Publications include a handheld guide, promotional brochure, guide activities and educational programs, educational and recreational, guide to the Dinosaur Coast and guide to Discovering the MUJA children for children.Educational workshops.Educational workshops on the interpretation of palaeontology are a special feature of the museum which are designed for education of children and young people. It caters to individuals in the age group of 4 to 11. The museum\'s scientific team organized the 7th Geological Heritage Meeting of the Geological Society of Spain, the 24th Spanish Palaeontological Society Meeting, and the 5th Spanish Jurassic Congress. The 11th International Ichnofabric Workshop will be held in 2011 in MUJA.'),(6196177,'The_Torture_Papers_(album)','The Torture Papers (album).The Torture Papers is the debut album from underground hip hop collective Army of the Pharaohs, released March 21, 2006 on Babygrande Records.

Prior to this, under the name Lubov Roudenko she was a former soloist for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in the late 1930s and early 1940s, afterwards performing on Broadway throughout the 40s.Early life.Luba Rudenko was born c.1915 in Sofia, Bulgaria, to Russian parents. Her parents were refugees, the rest of the Rudenko family having been killed in the Russian Revolution. They moved to Paris, where her father ran a Russian restaurant until it was forced to close following the 1932 assassination of President Paul Doumer. Following this, the family relied on Luba\'s skill as a dancer to help them, with Luba later recollecting There were times when I had to win first place in a contest so we could eat.Dancing.In the 1930s Rudenko was signed up to the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where she became their youngest soloist. Her stage name was Lubov Roudenko. She had a can-can sequence in the 1938 ballet Gat Parisienne choreographed specially for her by Lonide Massine. She would later reprise this role in the 1941 Oscar-nominated short film The Gay Parisian. Whilst with the Ballet Russes, Rudenko was the subject of several drawings by Henri Matisse in 1939. Four of his portrait sketches of her are now in the Fogg Museum. Matisse also made a drawing of Rudenko in the ballet  Rouge et Noir. While on tour with the Ballet Russe, Rudenko performed the role of the Cowgirl in the 1942 ballet Rodeo until the tour reached New York and Agnes de Mille, the original choreographer, reclaimed the role for herself. Disappointed by this, Rudenko quit the Ballet Russes, and took a better-paid job performing in a Broadway production of The Merry Widow. This production launched at the Majestic Theatre on 4 August 1943, with Rudenko and James Starbuck leading the character dances, including a comic polka and a can-can number. After this, Rudenko played Grisette in Nellie Bly, a short-lived 1946 musical based on the life of Nellie Bly, and then became lead dancer for the 1946-49 Broadway production of Annie Get Your Gun, but following a knee injury, decided to pursue a career in fashion design. She continued performing until 1951, appearing in the 1950-51 Olsen and Johnson revue Pardon our French.Fashion.Luba married Richard Marks in 1948, and in 1957, they launched their new company, Elite Juniors. Elite Jrs. was a middle-range firm producing high-style coats, suits and separates for a fifth of the expected price. Luba first caught the attention of the fashion press by successfully reinterpreting the classic Chanel suit for ready-to-wear. Her designs were cut slim-fitting, with narrow sleeves and no bust darts, meaning that her designs looked more elegant and desirably Parisian than those of her rivals in the ready-to-wear field. Luba was also noted as an early promoter of the woman\'s pantsuit in America, dedicating over half of her 1966 collection to this look. It was noted that some of her pantsuit designs came out before Yves Saint Laurent produced his own very similar designs.In 1968, alongside George Halley, Luba Marks won the Coty Award for her womenswear. At the time it was noted that her clothes were worn by smart young women such as actress Jill St. John and singer Petula Clark, and younger women in politics such as Luci Nugent. Luba noted that her clientele\'s age range ran from 16 to 70.By 1976 Elite Juniors had been acquired by Peabody House, and despite their marriage having broken down, the Markses were still working together successfully. That year Luba predicted that the business would turn over 7 to 8 million dollars, forecasting that this would rise to 12 million.'),(43285479,'We_Thieves_Are_Honourable','We Thieves Are Honourable.We Thieves Are Honourable (play), a play by Enrique Jardiel PoncelaWe Thieves Are Honourable (1942 film), a Spanish film directed by Ignacio F.

Urine and feces together are called excreta.Collected feces has various uses, namely as fertilizer or soil conditioner in agriculture, as a fuel source, or for medicinal purposes (fecal transplants or fecal bacteriotherapy, in the case of human feces).Ecology.After an animal has digested eaten material, the remains of that material are discharged from its body as waste. Although it is lower in energy than the food from which it is derived, feces may retain a large amount of energy, often 50% of that of the original food. This means that of all food eaten, a significant amount of energy remains for the decomposers of ecosystems. Many organisms feed on feces, from bacteria to fungi to insects such as dung beetles, who can sense odors from long distances. Some may specialize in feces, while others may eat other foods as well. Feces serve not only as a basic food, but also as a supplement to the usual diet of some animals. This is known as coprophagia, and occurs in various animal species such as young elephants eating the feces of their mothers in order to gain essential gut flora, or by other animals such as dogs, rabbits, and monkeys.Feces and urine, which reflect ultraviolet light, are important to raptors such as kestrels, who can see the near ultraviolet and thus find their prey by their middens and territorial markers.Seeds also may be found in feces. Animals who eat fruit are known as frugivores. An advantage for a plant in having fruit is that animals will eat the fruit and unknowingly disperse the seed in doing so. This mode of seed dispersal is highly successful, as seeds dispersed around the base of a plant are unlikely to succeed and often are subject to heavy predation. Provided the seed can withstand the pathway through the digestive system, it is not only likely to be far away from the parent plant, but is even provided with its own fertilizer.Organisms that subsist on dead organic matter or detritus are known as detritivores, and play an important role in ecosystems by recycling organic matter back into a simpler form that plants and other autotrophs may absorb once again. This cycling of matter is known as the biogeochemical cycle. To maintain nutrients in soil it is therefore important that feces return to the area from which they came, which is not always the case in human society where food may be transported from rural areas to urban populations and then feces disposed of into a river or sea.Characteristics.The distinctive odor of feces is due to bacterial action. Gut flora produce compounds such as indole, skatole, and thiols (sulfur-containing compounds), as well as the inorganic gas hydrogen sulfide. These are the same compounds that are responsible for the odor of flatulence. Consumption of foods prepared with spices may result in the spices being undigested and adding to the odor of feces.The perceived bad odor of feces has been hypothesized to be a deterrent for humans, as consuming or touching it may result in sickness or infection. Human perception of the odor may be contrasted by a non-human animal\'s perception of it; for example, an animal who eats feces may be attracted to its odor.Human feces.In humans and depending on the individual and the circumstances, defecation may occur from once every two or three days to several times a day. Extensive hardening of the feces may cause prolonged interruption in the routine and is called constipation.Human fecal matter varies significantly in appearance, depending on diet and health. Normally it is semisolid, with a mucus coating. The brown coloration comes from a combination of bile and bilirubin, which comes from dead red blood cells.In newborn babies, initially fecal matter is yellow-green after the meconium. This coloration comes from the presence of bile alone. In time, as the body starts expelling bilirubin from dead red blood cells, it acquires its familiar brown appearance, unless the baby is breast feeding, in which case it remains soft, pale yellowish, and not completely malodorous, until the baby begins to eat significant amounts of other food.Throughout the life of an ordinary human, one may experience many types of feces. A green stool is from rapid transit of feces through the intestines (or the consumption of certain blue or green food dyes in quantity), and clay-like appearance to the feces is the result of a lack of bilirubin.Pets.Pets can be trained to use litter boxes or wait to be allowed outside to defecate. Training can be done in several ways, especially dependent on species. An example is crate training for dogs. Several companies market cleaning products for pet owners whose pets have soiled carpets in the home.Manure, fertilizer, and special products.The feces of animals often are used as fertilizer; see manure and guano. In northern Thailand, elephants are used to digest coffee beans for Black Ivory coffee, which is among the world\'s most expensive coffees. Human feces also may be used as fertilizer (reuse of excreta in agriculture), and has also been known as night soil.Fuel.Dry animal dung is used as a fuel source in many countries around the world by burning it.Animals such as the giant panda and zebra possess gut bacteria capable of producing biofuel. The bacteria, Brocadia anammoxidans, can create the rocket fuel hydrazine from feces.Fecal transplant, gut flora transplant.In humans, fecal transplants (or stool transplant) is the process of transplantation of fecal bacteria from a healthy individual into a recipient who is suffering from a certain disease, such as irritable bowel syndrome. The resulting inoculation of healthy gut flora can sometimes improve the physiology of the recipient gut.Fecal bacteriotherapy  also known as a fecal transplant  is a medical procedure wherein fecal bacteria are transplanted from a healthy individual into a patient. Recent research indicates that this may be a valuable method to reestablish normal gut cultures that have been destroyed through the use of antibiotics or some other medical treatments.Elephants, hippos, koalas and pandas are born with sterile intestines, and require bacteria obtained from eating the feces of their mothers to digest vegetation.Coprolites and paleofeces.A coprolite is fossilized feces and is classified as a trace fossil. In paleontology they give evidence about the diet of an animal. They were first described by William Buckland in 1829. Prior to this they were known as fossil fir cones and bezoar stones. They serve a valuable purpose in paleontology because they provide direct evidence of the predation and diet of extinct organisms. Coprolites may range in size from a few millimetres to more than 60 centimetres.Paleofeces are ancient human feces, often found as part of archaeological excavations or surveys. Intact feces of ancient people may be found in caves in arid climates and in other locations with suitable preservation conditions. These are studied to determine the diet and health of the people who produced them through the analysis of seeds, small bones, and parasite eggs found inside. These feces may contain information about the person excreting the material as well as information about the material. They also may be analyzed chemically for more in-depth information on the individual who excreted them, using lipid analysis and ancient DNA analysis. The success rate of usable DNA extraction is relatively high in paleofeces, making it more reliable than skeletal DNA retrieval.The reason this analysis is possible at all is due to the digestive system not being entirely efficient, in the sense that not everything that passes through the digestive system is destroyed. Not all of the surviving material is recognizable, but some of it is. Generally, this material is the best indicator archaeologists can use to determine ancient diets, as no other part of the archaeological record is so direct an indicator.A process that preserves feces in a way that they may be analyzed later is called the Maillard reaction. This reaction creates a casing of sugar that preserves the feces from the elements. To extract and analyze the information contained within, researchers generally have to freeze the feces and grind it up into powder for analysis.Other uses.Some animal feces, especially those of camel, bison, and cattle, are used as fuel when dried. Animal dung, besides being used as fuel, occasionally is used as a cement to make adobe mudbrick huts, or even in throwing sports such as cow pat throwing or camel dung throwing contests.Kopi Luwak (pronounced), or civet coffee, is coffee made from coffee berries that have been eaten by and passed through the digestive tract of the Asian palm civet (Paradoxurus hermaphroditus). Giant pandas provide fertilizer for the world\'s most expensive green tea.Dog feces were used in the tanning process of leather during the Victorian era. Collected dog feces were mixed with water to form a substance known as bate. Enzymes in the dog feces helped to relax the fibrous structure of the hide before the final stages of tanning.Mycobacterium vaccae is a potentially beneficial mind-altering bacteria, which initially was isolated from cow dung.Feelings of disgust.In all human cultures, feces elicit varying degrees of disgust, a basic human emotion. Disgust is experienced primarily in relation to the sense of taste (either perceived or imagined) and, secondarily to anything that causes a similar feeling by sense of smell, touch, or vision. As such, human feces is regarded as something to be avoided diligently: expelled in private and disposed of immediately and without a trace. It often is considered an unacceptable topic in polite conversation and its mere mention may cause offence in certain contexts. An example from the ancient world of the repulsion people have felt toward feces is found in Deuteronomy 23:12-14.12Designate a place outside the camp where you can go to relieve yourself. 13 As part of your equipment have something to dig with, and when you relieve yourself, dig a hole and cover up your excrement. 14 For the LORD your God moves about in your camp to protect you and to deliver your enemies to you. Your camp must be holy, so that he will not see among you anything indecent and turn away from you.The disposal of feces always has been associated with the lowest people among a society, the social outcasts, the pariahs, and the social discards. The Caste system in India was created along the lines of profession and the dalits (untouchables) were left to do work related to human emissions. They did such work as cleaning and picking feces from streets, cleaning toilets, and working with dead bodies. Such practices are prevalent even today in the rural and small villages of India. It is called manual scavenging in India.Etymology.The word faeces is the plural of the Latin word faex meaning dregs. In most English-language usage, there is no singular form, making the word a plurale tantum; out of various major dictionaries, only one enters variation from plural agreement.Synonyms.The word feces is used more in biology and medicine than in other fields (reflecting science\'s tradition of classical Latin and New Latin); for example, in hunting and tracking, terms such as dung, scat, spoor, and droppings normally are used to refer to non-human animal feces, and in husbandry and farming, manure is common.Human feces.Stool is a common term in reference to human feces. For example, in medicine, to diagnose the presence or absence of a medical condition, a stool sample sometimes is requested for testing purposes. In this use, the term stool derives from the noun stool of ease or close stool, a piece of furniture enclosing a chamber pot that could be used during the night and closed afterward, awaiting disposal during the day. But despite its origins, the term stool is now sometimes used for any feces, including those of non-human species. The term bowel movement(s) (with each movement a defecation event) is also common in health care.There are many other terms in informal registers for feces. Many are euphemismistic, colloquial, or both; some are profane (such as shit), whereas most belong chiefly to child-directed speech (such as poo, poop, number two, doodoo, or doody) or to crude humor (such as deuce, turd, or crap).'),(34511851,'Roosevelt_House','Roosevelt House.Roosevelt House, a former high-rise apartment building for senior citizens, in Atlanta, Georgia; see Roosevelt HouseRoosevelt House Public Policy Institute at Hunter CollegeIsaac Roosevelt House, Hyde Park, New York, listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic PlacesSara Delano Roosevelt Memorial House, New York, New York, NRHP-listedHome of Franklin D.

Wolfgang Pauli and Felix Villars published the method in 1949, based on earlier work by Richard Feynman, Ernst Stueckelberg and Dominique Rivier.In this treatment, a divergence arising from a loop integral (such as vacuum polarization or electron self-energy) is modulated by a spectrum of auxiliary particles added to the Lagrangian or propagator. When the masses of the fictitious particles are taken as an infinite limit (i.e., once the regulator is removed) one expects to recover the original theory.This regulator is gauge invariant due to the auxiliary particles being minimally coupled to the photon field through the gauge covariant derivative. It is not gauge covariant, though, so PauliVillars regularization cannot be used in QCD calculations. PV serves as an alternative to the more favorable dimensional regularization in specific circumstances, such as in chiral phenomena, where a change of dimension alters the properties of the Dirac gamma matrices.Gerard \'t Hooft and Martinus J. G. Veltman invented, in addition to dimensional regularization, the method of unitary regulators, which is a Lagrangian-based PauliVillars method with a discrete spectrum of auxiliary masses, using the path-integral formalism.Examples.PauliVillars regularization consists of introducing a fictitious mass term. For example, we would replace a photon propagator formula_1, by formula_2, where formula_3 can be thought of as the mass of a fictitious heavy photon, whose contribution is subtracted from that of an ordinary photon.'),(20130800,'M_protein_(Streptococcus)','M protein (Streptococcus).M protein is a virulence factor that can be produced by certain species of Streptococcus.Viruses, parasites and bacteria are covered in protein and sugar molecules that help them gain entry into a host by counteracting the host\'s defences. One such molecule is the M protein produced by certain streptococcal bacteria. M proteins embody a motif that is now known to be shared by many Gram-positive bacterial surface proteins. The motif includes a conserved pentapeptide LPXTG, which precedes a hydrophobic C-terminal membrane anchor, which itself precedes a cluster of basic residues.M protein is strongly anti-phagocytic and is a major virulence factor. It binds to serum factor H, destroying C3-convertase and preventing opsonization by C3b. However plasma B cells can generate antibodies against M protein which will help in opsonization and further the destruction of the microorganism by the macrophages and neutrophilis. Cross-reactivity of anti-M protein antibodies with heart muscle has been suggested to be the basis for rheumatic fever.It was originally identified by Rebecca Lancefield, who also formulated the Lancefield classification system for streptococcal bacteria. Bacteria like S. pyogenes, which possess M protein are classified in group A of the Lancefield system.'),(45853689,'Murder_of_Gary_Triano','Murder of Gary Triano.Gary Lee Triano (November 6, 1943November 1, 1996) was a millionaire real estate developer from Tucson, Arizona who was killed in Catalina Foothills by a pipe bomb explosion in his Lincoln Town Car on November 1, 1996.

Phillips, who is now incarcerated at the Arizona State Prison Complex - Perryville, claims that Triano\'s death was a mob revenge killing. Ronald Young, who was hired by Phillips as a hit man was also convicted and sentenced to life in prison.Background.Gary Triano was a longtime Tucson, Arizona resident. He graduated from Rincon High School and earned a degree in accounting from the University of Arizona. He also attended the University of Arizona\'s law school. He married Mary Cram, and they had two children, Melissa and Brian.Triano married his second wife, Pamela Phillips, on October 4, 1986 in San Diego, California. During their marriage, the couple had two children - Trevor and Lois - before acrimoniously divorcing in 1993. At the time of the divorce, Triano filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, claiming $40 million in debt after several failed business dealings regarding Indian casinos. Phillips moved to Aspen, Colorado with the couple\'s two children, where she continued her career in commercial real estate.Murder.On November 1, 1996, Gary Triano was killed when a pipe bomb exploded in his car at the La Paloma Country Club in Catalina Foothills, Arizona. Within weeks, the investigation centered around his ex-wife Pamela Phillips, who was still living in Aspen. It was discovered that she had taken out a $2 million life insurance policy against Triano shortly before his death. The couple\'s two children were the beneficiaries of the policy, which was paid out to Phillips in 1997. Evidence also linked Phillips to Ronald Young, a small-time criminal with whom Phillips developed a relationship while in Aspen. Shortly before the bombing, a van rented by Young was found abandoned in Yorba Linda, California, and inside the vehicle there were documents pertaining to Phillips and Triano\'s divorce, a map of Tucson, Arizona, and a sawed-off shotgun.Nine years after the murder, on November 19, 2005, an episode of America\'s Most Wanted profiled Ronald Young, who was then wanted for forgery and embezzlement. The episode also mentioned his suspected involvement in Triano\'s death. Two days later, Young was apprehended in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He served a 10-month sentence in federal prison for weapon possession before being extradited back to Aspen. Following Young\'s arrest, investigators found records of phone and e-mail correspondences between Young and Phillips related to Triano\'s murder.In 2008, Ronald Young was charged with the murder of Gary Triano. On December 3, 2009, Pamela Phillips was also arrested for Triano\'s murder in Vienna, Austria, when she fled after her indictment in October 2008. She was later returned to the United States to stand trial.Trials.Ronald Young went to trial for Gary Triano\'s murder in 2010. Prosecutors showed records that Phillips agreed to give Young $400,000 to kill her ex-husband. Also introduced into evidence were the tapes and recordings outlining the conspiracy. At the conclusion of his trial, Young was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder. He was sentenced to two life terms.Following her extradition to Arizona to stand trial, Pamela Phillips was held on $5 million bond at the Pima County Jail. In December 2011, she was initially ruled mentally incompetent for trial. In October 2012, she was ruled competent to stand trial after undergoing treatment at the jail.Phillips\' trial began in 2014 and lasted for seven weeks. Prosecutors used similar evidence in her trial that was used to convict Young. Phillips was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy. Like Young, she was also sentenced to life in prison; she has no possibility for parole.In the media.The murder of Gary Triano has been televised on several programs, including Dateline NBC, 48 Hours, Snapped, and American Greed.'),(26430462,'Elance','Elance.Elance is an online staffing platform based in Mountain View, California, United States operated by Upwork.Background.Elance was first launched in 1999, its name inspired by a 1998 Harvard Business Review article titled The Dawn of the E-Lance Economy. It was initially developed as a technology for supporting virtual work. Two years later Elance introduced a vendor management system (VMS) for contractors and third-party services used by large enterprises. In 2006 Elance sold its enterprise software division and developed instead its current web-based platform for online, contingent work., Elance is used by approximately 500,000 businesses and 2 million registered freelance professionals, who have collectively earned nearly $850 million to date.A merger with oDesk, another online staffing platform, was confirmed in December 2013. The deal was finalized in April 2014 and the two companies will create a resource that consists of 8 million freelancers and 2 million businesses.Elance-oDesk relaunched as Upwork in May 2015 with Elance remaining as an Upwork company. Although Elance is still a stand-alone site operated by Upwork, it is expected to merge into the Upwork platform in the near future. The two platforms consist of 10 million freelancers and 4 million businesses.Clients.The Elance website allows businesses to post jobs, search for freelance professionals, and solicit proposals. They can evaluate the contractors applying for the job and, once a contractor is selected, communications and files are exchanged through the Elance system. Payment for jobs, which can either be hourly-rate or project-based jobs, is made by the client through Elance\'s system, which deducts a percentage of the fee, 8.75%, as a commission. Elance\'s Work View tool provides an official record of work completed. For project-based jobs statement of work or milestones are used to indicate progress toward completion, and funds are held in escrow by Elance to ensure payment upon completion of the milestone.Freelancers.Freelancers search Elance\'s website for jobs and can research clients\' buying histories on the system. Each freelancer can post a profile displaying past jobs and feedback, a portfolio, and specific skill and educational-background information.Registered free users are allowed to submit a limited number of proposals each month while those on paid membership plans can submit additional proposals. Elance offers payment guarantee once work is done using the Elance system.A 2012 survey of freelancers conducted by Elance indicated that freelancing was the sole source of income for 48% of respondents and that 69% had at least a bachelor\'s degree.Skills.Information technology jobs, such as web and mobile programming and development, account for the majority of earnings on Elance (59%), followed by creative jobs (24%), marketing (7%), and operations (7%). Jobs for writers and graphic designers are also popular. Elance maintains a current list of their overall top 100 in-demand skills, and in 2011, the most in-demand skills were PHP programming, WordPress programming, article writing, graphic design, and HTML programming. Specific data, including global job growth numbers and earnings on the most in-demand skills, is made available on Elance\'s website.Awards and recognition.Elance has been cited as an example of the emerging paradigm of informal workplace communication, employing social media tools and cloud-based applications to drive productivity. Elance also caters to the increasingly liquid labor market by facilitating direct contact between contractors with specific skillsets and clients with specific needs. This reduces search friction and benefits the economy as a whole.According to 2013 reports from Accenture and Deloitte that mention Elance, enterprises are increasingly looking to supplement their permanent employee workforce with flexible, extended workforces of project-based personnel. Business owners support the trend because it lowers their payroll expenditures, and workers support it because working for multiple clients results in increased job security. Project-based hiring also allows small businesses access to highly skilled workers at a significantly lower cost as compared to hiring full-time staff.In 2009, Elance was selected as one of CNET\'s Webware 100, an award recognizing products and services that embody Web 2.0 ideals of collaboration and cloud computing. In 2013, Elance was selected as one of Red Herring\'s top 100 companies.Issues.While Elance has received accolades by the technology industry and business community and there are some good reviews by those who have obtained work through this system, some of those people who actually compete for jobs using this social media have been more critical. Some complain of competition in a global job market with low rates and no benefits, work delivered but not paid for, job descriptions that are not always accurate.Merger.On December 18, 2013, Elance announced that it would sign a definitive agreement to merge with its competitor, oDesk to create an online workplace for a combined total of 8 million registered individuals. A joint statement issued on the same day stated that Fabio Rosati, chief executive officer of Elance, would lead the combined company. The new entity\'s name was to be announced after the deal was closed. According to Rosati, the executive team and board will be balanced with people from each company. Both websites would stay open, and the company will keep both Silicon Valley headquarters, with ODesk in Redwood City, California, and Elance in Mountain View, California. On May 4, 2015 Elance-oDesk announced that the company was relaunched as Upwork.'),(12900183,'Myoporum_rapense','Myoporum rapense.Myoporum rapense is a plant in the figwort family, Scrophulariaceae and is endemic to French Polynesia and the Kermadec Islands. It is closely related to Myoporum laetum and there are two subspecies which are found on different island groups.Description.Myoporum rapense is sometimes a low shrub and sometimes a tree growing to a height of with branches that have raised leaf scars. The leaves are arranged alternately and are long, wide, the same colour on both surfaces and have margins that are usually more or less serrated, especially on the outer half to three-quarters.The flowers are borne singly or in groups of up to 5 in the axils of leaves on stalks long and have 5 pointed sepals and 5 petals forming a bell-shaped tube. The tube is long with lobes about the same length or slightly shorter. The tube is white, usually spotted pale purple and is hairy inside and on the inner parts of the lobes. There are four stamens which extend beyond the petal tube. Flowers are usually present throughout the year and are followed by the fruit which is an oval-shaped, red, mauve or sometimes white drupe.Taxonomy.Myoporum rapense was first formally described in 1935 by Forest B. H. Brown and the description was published in Bernice P. Bishop Museum Bulletin. The specific epithet rapense refers to Rapa Island where the type specimen was collected by W.R.Sykes.Distribution and habitat.Myoporum rapense is found on the Austral and Kermadec Islands where it grows in coastal scrub, woodland, sand dunes or volcanic soils often on rocky hillsides.Conservation.Myoporum rapense is listed as being of least concern in the IUCN Red List.'),(4181006,'Kingswood_College_(Box_Hill)','Kingswood College (Box Hill).Kingswood College is coeducational K-12 college operating under the auspices of the Uniting Church in Australia, located in the eastern Melbourne suburb of Box Hill, Victoria, Australia. It began as New College in 1890, and was known as Box Hill Grammar from 1928 to 1965.History.In 1890 Arthur Stephenson established New College as a boy\'s school for day students and boarders in Rose Street Box Hill. The school was renamed Box Hill Grammar around 1928. The Methodist Church assumed responsibility for the school in 1929 and purchased a property in Station Street, Box Hill, known as \'Gwynton Park\'. A new building, the Cato Block, was built on the property in 1930. The move to the new site generated much optimism and a masterplan of imposing buildings was developed. The Great Depression and the Second World War made a large impression on the school - instead of implementing the masterplan, increased numbers of students had to be accommodated at virtually no cost.The school became co-educational in 1933 when girls were introduced to the Boarding section of the school. This practice was unheard of at that time in mainstream church schools in Victoria, if not Australia. In 1936 there were 14 girls at the school and in 1937, with 21 girls enrolled, co-educational classes were held. By 1945 there were 83 boys and 52 girls at the school and by 1955 the numbers of students had increased to 174 boys and 73 girls. However, the school reverted to only taking boys between 1964 and 1977.In 1937, the school granted Wesley College an option to purchase its land and buildings, in return for funds from Wesley to reduce some of the school\'s debt. In 1946, with Wesley struggling for space to accommodate increasing numbers, it opened negotiations to take over the school, and agreement was reached in 1947, which in effect vested the school in Wesley, but allowed the school to maintain its own council until Wesley was ready to proceed. Wesley was slow to proceed, and when Box Hill Grammar\'s own enrolments increased in the early 1950s, the council became less enamoured with the idea. In 1955 the idea was finally abandoned, with Wesley paying the school 4,500 to recoup losses while Wesley\'s control had restricted development.The school was renamed Kingswood College in 1965 to reflect both the Methodist tradition and to help create a new image of the school. Between 1963 and 1968 enrolments doubled - new buildings were urgently needed. A new science block and library were opened. The opening of the Junior School, in 1971, was a significant development for Kingswood College both financially and educationally. A new Senior School centre, named for Charles Fitzroy Walker former 36-year Principal, was opened in 1975, providing a unique environment for Year 11 and 12 students for a balanced academic and social education.During the 1990s the school tried to build on the educational, sporting and artistic programs of the College. Pre-School children now attend both 3 Year Old and 4 Year Old Kindergarten in Speedy House, the Pre-School centre. Computer, Food Technology and library facilities have been upgraded and a new Technology Centre was opened in 1996, which provides a modern environment for students to study graphics and develop skills in the area of Production Technology.A new Middle School centre, opened in 2002, has provided a base for Year 7 students and caters for a range of administrative functions. Landscaping to complement this building is currently being undertaken. In 2005 the refurbishments to the Junior School were completed with brand new grade 5 and 6 rooms. In 2008 construction began on a new Science Building, which was officially opened on the 28th of March, 2009. The former Science block was completely renovated and is currently the Year 10 Centre. In 2010 Brimacombe Hall was refurbished to provide a larger auditorium and additional performance and rehearsal spaces.The College is now in the first year of the current Strategic Plan. It has launched into a refurbishment and redevelopment plan with the completion of a Master Plan and overall landscape plan for the campus.The four houses are Walker (Green), Brunning (Red), Gwynton (Blue) and New (Yellow). The houses engage in traditional performing arts and sporting competition, including cross country along Gardiners Creek.The School also has strong relationships with 2 schools in China, known as sister schools. GaoXin No 1 High School in Xi\'an and Jiangsu Xishan Senior High School in Wuxi. Both participate strongly in exchange programs with Kingswood, as well as offering guided visits to china and its education system.'),(29307920,'Li_Jinglin','Li Jinglin.Li Jinglin, also known as Li Fangchen (1885  1931) was a deputy inspector-general and later army general for the Fengtian clique during the Chinese warlord era.

A renowned swordsman, he was known as China\'s First Sword.Military and administrative career.In 1924, during the Second ZhiliFengtian War, Li was commanding the Fengtian Second Army which aided Zhang Zongchang in his decisive victory at Longku; the engagement has been termed probably the single most important engagement in Zhili\'s defeat. In November his troops occupied Tianjin, where they picked up half of Wang Chengbin\'s forces, and under his command a repressive and predatory regime was establishedespecially noted is the extent to which the local merchants were extorted. The United States 15th Infantry Regiment, whose mission was to keep the Peking-Mukden Railway open, was based in Tianjin, and small skirmishes occurred between US troops and Li\'s troops. Like many other warlords who ruled Tianjin, Li also was a member of the Green Gang. From December 1924 to December 1925, he was the administrator of Hebei province.Martial arts.One of Li\'s nicknames is Magic Sword. A general in the Chinese army, Li displayed great skill as a swordfighter and great interest in martial arts, especially Wudang chuan. Li was nicknamed China\'s First Sword and God of the Sword. Li was an expert of many varying sword techniques, then later learned Wudang Sword from Sung Wei-I, a renowned swordsman who also taught Fu Chen Sung. His sword techniques were an amalgamate of the ancient Taoist and the newer Baguazhang styles.After his military career, he opened a martial arts center in Nanjing, and became vice-president of the National Martial Arts Academy, also known as Central Hall for National Martial Arts (Zhongyang Guoshuguan), and now called the Central Guoshu Institute.

The Westminster line was produced as the A90, A95, A99, A105, and A110 until 1968 when the new Austin 3-Litre took its place. Essentially badge-engineered versions of the Farina Westminsters were also produced using the premium Wolseley and Vanden Plas marques. 101,634 Westminsters were built.The Westminster name was previously used by the Austin Motor Company in the 1930s for a four light version of the 6 and the 4.A90.The A90 Six Westminster was introduced at the 1954 London Motor Show at the same time as the small A50 Cambridge saloon range. It used the new BMC C-Series straight-6 engine with single Zenith carburettor which, at 2.6L (2639cc), produced 85hp (63kW). The suspension is independent at the front using coil springs and wishbones and leaf spring and anti-roll bar on the live axle at the rear. The four-speed transmission has synchromesh on the top three ratios and from 1955 an overdrive unit could be specified.The interior, with leather trim on the de luxe version and PVC on the standard model, has a split bench front seat arrangement, although individually adjustable, which if necessary could seat three people abreast. When only two are carried there are, on the de luxe model, fold down centre armrests at the side of each seat. The de luxe model also has a central fold down armrest in the rear. The handbrake control is under the dash on the right hand side of the steering column which also carries the gear change lever. A heater is fitted as standard on the de luxe model but optional on the standard version.

The test car cost 834 including taxes.The A90 designation had previously been carried by the 194852 Austin Atlantic. 25,532 A90 Six Westminsters were built.A95/A105.In May 1956, for a brief period only, a derivative of the A90 Six Westminster was announced which was a short boot version of the A105 and had the twin SU carburettor/102hp version of the 2.6-litre C series engine with overdrive as standard. In October 1956 the A105 received the longer wheelbase with overdrive as standard and automatic transmission as an option. Twin fog lights heater and wheeltrims were standard although a radio was still an option. Twotone paint and white-wall tyres were introduced for visual effect. Very few short boot versions of the A105 were produced and they are now quite rare.The A90 was updated for autumn 1956 as the A95. Along with more power, the A95 was longer and now offered an estate model. Overdrive and an automatic transmission were new as well, something of a novelty in British cars of the time.Both the A95 and A105 were produced together until 1959. 28,065 A95s and 6,770 A105s were built.The Westminster name was dropped from the sales literature for the A95 and the A105 although, oddly, the drivers\' handbooks still used the name Westminster to title the illustration of the saloon. The estate version was titled Countryman. Nevertheless, most enthusiasts still refer to them as Westminsters.A badge-engineered version of the A95 with different grille, trim, and badges and a bench front seat was assembled and sold in Australia as the Morris Marshal from 1957 until 1960.An A105 saloon with overdrive tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1956 had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0 in 15.4 seconds.

This was done after a personal request from Leonard Lord in 1957. Changes included significant new interior fittings, and a grey stripe bearing the Princess crown on the side of the body; most bodies were in sombre colours such as black or maroon.A99.The A99 Westminster appeared in 1959 with new Pininfarina-designed bodywork. Pininfarina had also re-styled Austin\'s compact A40 and mid-sized A55 Cambridge ranges the year before. Under the bonnet was the 2.9L (2912cc) C-Series straight-6 engine with twin SU carburettors from the Austin-Healey 3000. This engine produced 103hp (77kW) in Westminster tune. A three-speed all-synchromesh manual gearbox with a Borg-Warner overdrive unit was fitted as standard, or a Borg-Warner automatic transmission as an option. Power-assisted Lockheed brakes with discs on the front wheels were also new.An A99 saloon with automatic transmission was tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1960 and they recorded a top speed of, acceleration from 0 in 17.9 seconds and a fuel consumption of.

The genus was adequately named after Makara, a Hindu mythological animal, half-mammal (often an elephant), half-fish, and cetus, Latin for whale. The species name, bidens, is Latin for two-teeth, in reference to the retention of only two incisors in each premaxilla. Makaracetus unique features even lead to propose a new classification of Protocidae based on the degree of their aquatic adaptation; with Makarcetus alone in the subfamily Makaracetinae.A combination of cranial features indicate that Makaracetus had a short, muscular proboscis similar to a tapir. There are broad and shallow narial grooves on the dorsal side of the premaxilla extending the nasal vestibule to the anterior end of the rostrum. These grooves are paralleled on the ventral side by extraordinary lateral fossae, stretching from the anterior maxilla and over the premaxilla. The rostrum is angled downwards, like in a dugong, and has a reduced number of incisors. Enlarged foramina in front of the orbits indicate that the rostrum had a rich blood supply.No living mammal displays this combination of characteristics. The expanded nasal is present in tapirs, but they are not aquatic animals. The morphology of sirenian rostra is similar, but sirenians are herbivorous whereas Makaracetus dentition clearly indicate that it was carnivorous. Walrus cranial morphology is different, but they are aquatic and use specialized buccal and facial muscles to feed on mollusks, fossils of which are abundant in the Domanda Formation, and they probably provide the best ecological model among living mammals.

She is the founder and Creative Director of Weitzner Design, Inc., a New-York-based design studio, and the head of the Weitzner Limited brand.Career.Weitzner studied design at Syracuse University and earned a BFA in Textiles. After graduating in 1983 she traveled to Europe where she worked as a freelance designer selling to Italian and Swiss fabric makers such as Missoni and Schlossberg. Afterward she returned to New York where she did packaging design for Este Lauder, Elizabeth Arden and Calvin Klein; product design for Dansk, Rosenthal, Marcel Schurman and Johnson & Johnson; display design for Saks Fifth Avenue, Barneys and Florian Papp; and environmental designs for Lufthansa, amongst others.In 1993 she began working for world-renowned textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen. With Larsen, Weitzner was given the opportunity to create independently-designed collections that bore her name. Their collaboration produced many celebrated designs, a lot of which are now housed in museums worldwide. In 2007 the Minneapolis Institute of Art honored the pair with a special exhibition under the title The Jack Lenor Larsen Studio Part II, The Lori Weitzner Years 1992-1995.In 2000 she began designing fabric and wallpaper for Sahco Hesslein, becoming the first woman and the first American to design for the renowned German textile manufacturer. In 2004 she launched Weitzner Limited, an innovative textile and wall covering company known for combining modern techniques with unconventional materials. Some notable wallpapers include Newsworthy, made from 100% upcycled newspapers hand-woven together with nylon thread in a similar technique used with grass cloth and finished with a water-based topcoat; Quarry, made out of super-thin layers of actual rock; and Magnetism, a wallpaper coated in magnetic minerals. In 2011 Weitzner Limited entered a merger agreement with Pollack Associates, a New York-based textile design company whose founders, like Weitzner, are alumni of Jack Lenor Larsens studio.Weitzners products grace celebrity homes including those of Julianne Moore, Will Ferrell, and Beyonc, and often appear as costumes and sets for movies such as Gangs of New York and \'.

It was written by Brad Falchuk, directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, and premiered on the Fox network on October 5, 2010. Prior to its broadcast, series co-creator Ryan Murphy predicted the episode would be Glee most controversial, as it focuses on religion and what God means to the members of the glee club. When Burt Hummel (Mike O\'Malley) has a heart attack, the glee club rally around his son Kurt (Chris Colfer), attempting to support the Hummels through their various faiths. Meanwhile, club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) believes he has found the face of Jesus in a grilled cheese sandwich.Murphy hoped to produce a balanced depiction of religion, and he, Falchuk and series co-creator Ian Brennan worked to ensure that there was an equality between pro and anti-religious sentiments expressed. The episode features seven cover versions of songs, each of which charted on the Billboard Hot 100, marking the series\' one-week debut high in the US. Critics disagreed over the appropriateness of the musical performances, with some complaining of the tangential relationship between the numbers and religion, and others appreciating that the Glee versions brought new meaning to the songs.Grilled Cheesus was watched by 11.20million US viewers, and was the second most watched scripted show of the week among adults aged 1849. It received mixed reviews, with Colfer and O\'Malley receiving critical acclaim, and several reviewers praising Glee for successfully balancing opposing viewpoints. However, other reviewers criticized the episode for its lack of subtlety, and Lisa Respers France of CNN denounced Grilled Cheesus as an Emmy-submission showpiece for Colfer.Plot.Glee club co-captain Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) believes he has found the face of Jesus in a grilled cheese sandwich, he asks for three prayers to be granted: for the school football team to win a game, for his girlfriend Rachel Berry (Lea Michele) to let him touch her breasts, and for him to be reinstated as quarterback. When his first prayer comes true, he asks the glee club to join him in honoring Jesus through song.Club member Kurt Hummel (Chris Colfer) is devastated when his father Burt Hummel (Mike O\'Malley) suffers a heart attack. His best friend Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley) sings Whitney Houston\'s I Look to You to him, hoping he will find strength in faith. However, Kurt reveals that he is an atheist. Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester (Jane Lynch), also an atheist, takes umbrage at the glee club singing religious songs in a public school setting, and has Kurt make a formal complaint. When confronted by guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays), Sue admits that as a child, she prayed that God would cure her sister Jean (Robin Trocki), who has Down syndrome. Her prayers went unanswered, leading her to conclude that God simply does not exist.Mercedes, Rachel and Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron) pray for Burt, with Rachel singing Papa, Can You Hear Me? from Yentl at his bedside. Kurt is resistant, and later at glee club rehearsal sings The Beatles\' I Want to Hold Your Hand, stating that his faith takes the form of love for his father. He accepts an invitation from Mercedes to attend her church, where the choir sing Bridge over Troubled Water. At the church service, Mercedes asks the congregation to pray for the Hummels.Finn\'s remaining prayers also come true. Rachel comes to Finn\'s house one evening, and in his bedroom she admits that she would prefer to raise her children in the Jewish faith; she would not be able to have a future with him if he puts his faith in Jesus. Finn agrees that their children would be raised as she chooses, so to confirm her trust and appreciation of him, she allows him to touch the side of her breast as they make out. Later, Finn is also reinstated as quarterback, but it occurs because his replacement Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) is injured during a game, dislocating his shoulder. Finn feels responsible and confesses his guilt to Emma, who tells him it is unlikely God is communicating specifically with him through a grilled cheese sandwich. A despondent Finn doubts his new-found faith, singing R.E.M.\'s Losing My Religion.At Burt\'s bedside, Kurt tells his still unconscious father that he feels he should have accepted his friends\' prayers. As Kurt cries, Burt begins to regain consciousness and is able to squeeze his son\'s hand. Meanwhile, Sue visits Jean in her residential home and discusses God with her sister. Jean asks Sue if she may pray for her, and Sue accepts. Later, the glee club comes together to sing Joan Osborne\'s One of Us. Sue watches the performance, but tells Will she will not report him for allowing a religious song. At home, Finn eats the remainder of the grilled cheese sandwich.Production.Grilled Cheesus is intended to begin a season arc depicting the glee club members rallying around those who are subject to bullying and persecution. For Glee second season, Murphy confirmed plans to cast a Christian character on the show, expressing desires to keep Glee a show about inclusiveness. In an interview with TV Guide, Murphy said on Christianity, If we\'re trying to form a world of inclusiveness, we\'ve got to include that point of view as well. He predicted Grilled Cheesus would be the most controversial episode of the series to date, as it depicts the spiritual and emotional importance of God to the characters. Murphy aimed to address religion in a socially responsible way, and compared Grilled Cheesus to topical Norman Lear shows of the 1970s. He hoped to produce a balanced depiction of the subject matter, and he, along with co-writers Brennan and Falchuk, checked the script to ensure that for every anti-religious sentiment conveyed, there was a pro-religious one to counterbalance it. The episode references several religions apart from Christianity; Puck and Rachel are both Jewish, Kurt hires an acupuncturist who is a Sikh, and makes a reference to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.Sue\'s philosophical argument with Emma about religion is the scene that Murphy is most proud to have been involved with in [his] entire career. Explaining Sue\'s stance on religion, he stated: Sue\'s an atheist, but I love that she doesn\'t want to be. She and [Kurt] are both saying to the world, \'Prove us wrong: If God is kindness and love, make me believe in God. Murphy felt it would have been easy to have Kurt sing an anti-religious song, but instead chose to have him sing about his faith in love.O\'Malley was a recurring cast member throughout Glee first season, and was promoted to a series regular starting in season two. He commented that the episode would be an emotional one, developing the father-son relationship further. Recurring characters who appear in this episode include glee club member Mike Chang (Harry Shum, Jr.), football player Sam Evans, Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), football coach Shannon Beiste (Dot-Marie Jones), Finn\'s mother Carole Hudson (Romy Rosemont), and Sue\'s sister Jean Sylvester. An eight-year-old Kurt appears in a series of flashback scenes, including his mother\'s funeral, played by child actor Adam Kolkin.Music.The episode featured cover versions of Billy Joel\'s Only the Good Die Young, Whitney Houston\'s I Look to You, Papa, Can You Hear Me? as performed by Barbra Streisand in the musical film Yentl, The Beatles\' I Want to Hold Your Hand as covered by T. V. Carpio in the musical film Across the Universe, R.E.M.\'s Losing My Religion, Simon & Garfunkel\'s Bridge over Troubled Water as covered by Aretha Franklin, and Joan Osborne\'s One of Us. Monteith said he and series music producer Adam Anders had a bit of a different idea about how Losing My Religion should be performed. While Anders always brings the songs in very positive, very upbeat, he felt the song was expressing a betrayal, and with Finn feeling both betrayal and anger, Monteith wanted his performance to reflect that. All songs performed were released as singles, available for download, and I Want to Hold Your Hand and One of Us are included on the album \'. All singles charted on the Billboard Hot 100 and Canadian Hot 100. With seven new entries, it marked the series\' one-week debut high in the US. The best performing single was I Want to Hold Your Hand, which reached number 21 in Canada and 36 in the US. With 69,000 copies sold in the US, it also reached number 15 on the Hot Digital Songs chart.Zap2it\'s Carina Adly MacKenzie commented positively on Michele\'s beautiful rendition of Papa, Can You Hear Me?, however expressed displeasure that Rachel had cried during her solo in three consecutive episodes, suggesting the producers give her a more uplifting song. She praised Salling\'s Only the Good Die Young, which was selected by Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post as the best performance of the episode, for being the most in-keeping with Glee usual tone. Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised I Want to Hold Your Hand, writing that, the Beatles\' coy flirtation is replaced with a simple, wistful plea that hits just the right note. She commended Riley\'s vocals on Bridge over Troubled Water, commenting that Murphy should assign Mercedes more solo performances. Futterman criticized Losing My Religion, however, observing that Monteith struggled to reach the notes, resulting in a performance more awkward than inspired.Anthony Benigno of the Daily News commented positively on the arrangement of Monteith\'s song, grading the performance A. His lowest grade went to Papa, Can You Hear Me?, which he gave a C. Benigno felt that both Michele and Colfer\'s solos were damaged by the fact that the songs\' only link to the episode\'s plot were their titles, finding it particularly jarring to hear Kurt singing I wanna be your man about his father. The A.V. Club Todd VanDerWerff felt that the music was the worst aspect of the episode, similarly criticizing song selections based on their tangential relationship to religion. He felt that Kurt\'s performance was the only number which worked even slightly, commenting, it genuinely grows out of the moment, although the fact that Kurt is singing it to his dad never stops being kind of weird. Both Jessica Derschowitz of CBS News and MTV\'s Aly Semigran enjoyed that the performance of I Want to Hold Your Hand brought new meaning to the song, with Semigran naming it her favourite number of the episode. She felt that I Look to You was the episode\'s weakest song, preferring Riley\'s more powerful rendition of Bridge over Troubled Water. Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times expressed disappointment in both of Riley\'s songs, which left her strangely unmoved. She suggested that, Mercedes sang admirably, beautifully even, but she didnt seem truly transported by the music; so we weren\'t.Ratings.During its original broadcast, Grilled Cheesus was watched by 11.20million American viewers and attained a 4.6/13 share in the 1849 demographic. Viewership and ratings both decreased from the previous episode, which was watched by 13.51million viewers and attained a 5.9/17 rating/share. Grilled Cheesus was the most watched scripted show for the week of broadcast among adults aged 1849, and the twenty-second most watched show among all viewers. In Canada, the episode was watched by 1.99million viewers and was the eleventh most watched show of the week. It was again down on the previous episode, which was watched by 2.46million viewers, making it the sixth most watched programme of the week. In Australia, Grilled Cheesus drew 1.029million viewers, placing eleventh for the night. In the UK, the episode was watched by 2.502 million viewers (2.175 million on E4, and 327,000 on E4+1), becoming the most watched show on E4 and E4 +1 for the week, and the most watched show on cable for the week.Critical response.The episode received mixed reviews from critics. Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly named it as one of his favourite episodes of the series, calling it not only funny and moving, but incredibly important, both for its religious element and message of tolerance. Stack praised the performances by Colfer and O\'Malley, as did USA Today Robert Bianco, who deemed the episode a smart, moving, musical exploration of the power and limits of faith and religion in a democratic society. Bianco commented positively on the way Colfer\'s singing was used to dig beneath the archness and anger in Kurt\'s behavior, calling it a textbook example of what music can add to drama. Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald went further in his praise, deeming Grilled Cheesus the perfect blend of music, characterization and plot - and easily the most provocative scripted hour in prime-time of the new season. Perigard appreciated the fact there were no easy answers presented, with no characters undergoing religious conversions during the course of the episode. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal felt that Grilled Cheesus succeeded in balancing opposing viewpoints, resulting in a nuanced, atypical episode of Glee that was both conflictingly emotional and confidently serious about the topic of religion, and Semigran similarly commended the episode\'s balance, writing that Falchuk covered both sides of controversial debate with grace, humor, and most importantly, respect.Robert Canning of IGN felt that Grilled Cheesus was too varied tonally, failing to effectively bring together the true anguish of Kurt\'s storyline and lunacy of Finn\'s. He rated it 7.5/10, signifying a good episode, though his overall opinion was mixed. Canning commented that the Hummels\' relationship is the most affecting of the show, and praised O\'Malley\'s outstandingly nuanced performance as Burt, yet felt that the religious element gave the episode an after school special vibe and almost became over-the-top preachy and self-important. VanDerWerff graded the episode B-, commenting that he was uncertain whether he genuinely loved it, or was overlooking flaws because it handled the religious element acceptably. VanDerWerff stated that it would be easy to criticize Glee, but while television as a whole does not do earnestness well, Glee at its best, as in Grilled Cheesus, revels in just how damn earnest it can be. James Poniewozik of Time wrote that the episode\'s premise was absurdly ambitious, yet felt it was largely successful in being respectful to both atheism and religion. He criticized the musical numbers for detracting from the plot, but appreciated the focus on Kurt and Burt, also naming theirs one of Glee strongest and most nuanced relationships.Lisa Respers France of CNN was dismayed that the episode felt forced, like an Emmy submission showpiece for Colfer. She disliked Kurt\'s angry, overwrought reaction to his friends\' prayers and the silly grilled cheese sandwich subplot, however wished there had been more focus on the rich, barely tapped vein of the Sue subplot. The Atlantic Kevin Fallon criticized the episode\'s lack of subtlety, feeling that in its attempt to be controversial, Glee became a clichd after school special. Fallon had been excited to see religion and homosexuality tackled on Glee, but was disappointed that the end result was completely devoid of humor, with dialogue so stilted, wooden, and earnest that the treatment of the subject was largely ineffective and far too easy to make fun of. Benigno also commented negatively on the lack of subtlety, deeming it Glee biggest flaw. He commended Lynch\'s performance as Sue, however, writing: It\'s outrageous how good she is despite having only three scenes of screen time.'),(2319882,'DStv','DStv.DStv (Digital Satellite Television) is MultiChoice\'s digital satellite TV service in Africa, launched in 1995, providing various bouquets offering general entertainment, movies, lifestyle & culture, sport, documentaries, news & commerce, children, music, religion and consumer channels to MultiChoice subscribers.

The majestic bowl-like crater is deep. The volcano erupted from three craters 28,000 years ago, with the last eruptions from the southern crater filling the northern craters. The western face of the hill was extensively quarried. This is the site of a large ecological restoration project run by volunteers.Naming.Maungawhau means the \'Mountain of the whau tree (Entelea arborescens)\' in Mori. \'Mount Eden\' honours George Eden, 1st Earl of Auckland. The crater is called Te Ipu-a-Mataaho (the bowl of Mataaho); Mataaho was a deity said to live in the crater and to be the guardian of the secrets hidden in the earth.Tourism.Maungawhau / Mount Eden attracts many tourists, as it is the highest natural point in Auckland, and provides good views in all directions over the city. There used to be a large number of tourist buses driving to the summit but these were banned in 2011. The maunga authority agreed to a ban on all vehicles driving to the summit in 2015, but provision will be made for people with limited mobility.Other uses.From the 1950s the peak was used by the New Zealand Post Office for VHF radio communications in two buildings, several hundred metres apart, each with their own antenna farm. One building housed transmitting equipment, while the other housed receiving equipment. In the 1960s the site was staffed during the five-day working week due to the large number of valves that wore out under the stress of high power and needed frequent servicing. Typical use of the facility was for businesses e.g. taxi or delivery firms needing mobile communications to vehicles.An underground water reservoir has been located on the northern side of Maungawhau / Mount Eden since the 1870s. The original reservoir was replaced in 1912, and a second, complementary, reservoir added in 1930. The reservoirs, recently upgraded to meet growing demand, work together to supply the Mount Eden, Epsom, One Tree Hill and Khyber Pass areas.The trig station at the summit was used as a reference point for drawing up Auckland\'s suburbs. The platform was built with help from Prince Alfred\'s elephant. The elephant was rewarded with lollies, buns and beer.Treaty settlement.In the 2014 Treaty of Waitangi settlement with the Tamaki Makaurau Collective of 13 Auckland iwi, the volcano was officially named Maungawhau / Mount Eden and ownership was vested to the collective. It is now co-governed by the collective and Auckland Council in common benefit of the iwi and all other people of Auckland.'),(11861063,'Global_serializability','Global serializability.In concurrency control of databases, transaction processing (transaction management), and other transactional distributed applications, Global serializability (or Modular serializability) is a property of a global schedule of transactions. A global schedule is the unified schedule of all the individual database (and other transactional object) schedules in a multidatabase environment (e.g., federated database). Complying with global serializability means that the global schedule is serializable, has the serializability property, while each component database (module) has a serializable schedule as well. In other words, a collection of serializable components provides overall system serializability, which is usually incorrect. A need in correctness across databases in multidatabase systems makes global serializability a major goal for global concurrency control (or modular concurrency control). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, and small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), as well as increase in systems management sophistication, the need for atomic distributed transactions and thus effective global serializability techniques, to ensure correctness in and among distributed transactional applications, seems to increase.In a federated database system or any other more loosely defined multidatabase system, which are typically distributed in a communication network, transactions span multiple (and possibly distributed) databases. Enforcing global serializability in such system, where different databases may use different types of concurrency control, is problematic. Even if every local schedule of a single database is serializable, the global schedule of a whole system is not necessarily serializable. The massive communication exchanges of conflict information needed between databases to reach conflict serializability globally would lead to unacceptable performance, primarily due to computer and communication latency. Achieving global serializability effectively over different types of concurrency control has been open for several years. Commitment ordering (or Commit ordering; CO), a serializability technique publicly introduced in 1991 by Yoav Raz from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), provides an effective general solution for global (conflict) serializability across any collection of database systems and other transactional objects, with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. CO does not need the distribution of conflict information, but rather utilizes the already needed (unmodified) atomic commitment protocol messages without any further communication between databases. It also allows optimistic (non-blocking) implementations. CO generalizes Strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL), which in conjunction with the Two-phase commit (2PC) protocol is the de facto standard for achieving global serializability across (SS2PL based) database systems. As a result, CO compliant database systems (with any, different concurrency control types) can transparently join existing SS2PL based solutions for global serializability. The same applies also to all other multiple (transactional) object systems that use atomic transactions and need global serializability for correctness (see examples above; nowadays such need is not smaller than with database systems, the origin of atomic transactions).All these aspects, except the first two, are also possessed by the popular SS2PL, which is a (constrained, blocking) special case of CO and inherits many of CO\'s qualities.Quotations.Commitment ordering, publicly introduced in May 1991 (see below), provides an efficient elegant general solution, from both practical and theoretical points of view, to the global serializability problem across database systems with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. It provides conflict serializability with no negative effect on availability, and with no worse performance than the de facto standard for global serializability, CO\'s special case Strong strict two-phase locking (SS2PL). It requires knowledge about neither local nor global transactions.The commitment ordering solution comprises effective integration of autonomous database management systems with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. This while local and global transactions execute in parallel without restricting any read or write operation in either local or global transactions, and without compromising the systems\' autonomy.The quotation above is from a 1997 article proposing a relaxed global serializability solution (see Relaxing global serializability below), and referencing Commitment ordering (CO) articles. The CO solution supports effectively both full ACID properties and full local autonomy, as well as meeting the other requirements posed above in the Problem statement section, and apparently has been misunderstood.Also the above quoted article proposes a relaxed global serializability solution, while referencing the CO work. The CO solution for global serializability both bridges between different concurrency control protocols with no substantial concurrency reduction (and typically minor, if at all), and maintains the autonomy of local DBMSs. Evidently also here CO has been misunderstood. This misunderstanding continues to 2010 in a textbook by some of the same authors, where the same relaxed global serializability technique, Two level serializability, is emphasized and described in detail, and CO is not mentioned at all.The characteristics and properties of the CO solution are discussed below.Technology perspective.The problem of global serializability has been a quite intensively researched subject in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Commitment ordering (CO) has provided an effective general solution to the problem, insight into it, and understanding about possible generalizations of strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL), which practically and almost exclusively has been utilized (in conjunction with the Two-phase commit protocol (2PC)) since the 1980s to achieve global serializability across databases. An important side-benefit of CO is the automatic global deadlock resolution that it provides (this is applicable also to distributed SS2PL; though global deadlocks have been an important research subject for SS2PL, automatic resolution has been overlooked, except in the CO articles, until today (2009)). At that time quite many commercial database system types existed, many non-relational, and databases were relatively very small. Multi database systems were considered a key for database scalability by database systems interoperability, and global serializability was urgently needed. Since then the tremendous progress in computing power, storage, and communication networks, resulted in orders of magnitude increases in both centralized databases\' sizes, transaction rates, and remote access to database capabilities, as well as blurring the boundaries between centralized computing and distributed one over fast, low-latency local networks (e.g., Infiniband). These, together with progress in database vendors\' distributed solutions (primarily the popular SS2PL with 2PC based, a de facto standard that allows interoperability among different vendors\' (SS2PL-based) databases; both SS2PL and 2PC technologies have gained substantial expertise and efficiency), workflow management systems, and database replication technology, in most cases have provided satisfactory and sometimes better information technology solutions without multi database atomic distributed transactions over databases with different concurrency control (bypassing the problem above). As a result, the sense of urgency that existed with the problem at that period, and in general with high-performance distributed atomic transactions over databases with different concurrency control types, has reduced. However, the need in concurrent distributed atomic transactions as a fundamental element of reliability exists in distributed systems also beyond database systems, and so the need in global serializability as a fundamental correctness criterion for such transactional systems (see also Distributed serializability in Serializability). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), and sophisticated systems management the need for effective global serializability techniques to ensure correctness in and among distributed transactional applications seems to increase, and thus also the need in Commitment ordering (including the popular for databases special case SS2PL; SS2PL, though, does not meet the requirements of many other transactional objects).The commitment ordering solution.The only overhead incurred by the CO solution is locally detecting conflicts (which is already done by any known serializability mechanism, both pessimistic and optimistic) and locally ordering in each database system both the (local) commits of local transactions and the voting for atomic commitment of global transactions. Such overhead is low. The net effect of CO may be some delays of commit events (but never more delay than SS2PL, and on the average less). This makes CO instrumental for global concurrency control of multidatabase systems (e.g., federated database systems). The underlying Theory of Commitment ordering, part of Serializability theory, is both sound and elegant (and even mathematically beautiful; referring to structure and dynamics of conflicts, graph cycles, and deadlocks), with interesting implications for transactional distributed applications.All the qualities of CO in the list above, except the first three, are also possessed by SS2PL, which is a special case of CO, but blocking and constraining. This partially explains the popularity of SS2PL as a solution (practically, the only solution, for many years) for achieving global serializability. However, property 9 above, automatic resolution of global deadlocks, has not been noticed for SS2PL in the database research literature until today (2009; except in the CO publications). This, since the phenomenon of voting-deadlocks in such environments and their automatic resolution by the atomic commitment protocol has been overlooked.Most existing database systems, including all major commercial database systems, are strong strict two phase locking (SS2PL) based and already CO compliant. Thus they can participate in a CO based solution for global serializability in multidatabase environments without any modification (except for the popular multiversioning, where additional CO aspects should be considered). Achieving global serializability across SS2PL based databases using atomic commitment (primarily using two phase commit, 2PC) has been employed for many years (i.e., using the same CO solution for a specific special case; however, no reference is known prior to CO, that notices this special case\'s automatic global deadlock resulotion by the atomic commitment protocol\'s augmented-conflict-graph global cycle elimination process). Virtually all existing distributed transaction processing environments and supporting products rely on SS2PL and provide 2PC. As a matter of fact SS2PL together with 2PC have become a de facto standard. This solution is a homogeneous concurrency control one, suboptimal (when both Serializability and Strictness are needed; see Strict commitment ordering; SCO) but still quite effective in most cases, sometimes at the cost of increased computing power needed relatively to the optimum. (However, for better performance relaxed serializability is used whenever applications allow). It allows inter-operation among SS2PL-compliant different database system types, i.e., allows heterogeneity in aspects other than concurrency control. SS2PL is a very constraining schedule property, and takes over when combined with any other property. For example, when combined with any optimistic property, the result is not optimistic anymore, but rather characteristically SS2PL. On the other hand, CO does not change data-access scheduling patterns at all, and any combined property\'s characteristics remain unchanged. Since also CO uses atomic commitment (e.g., 2PC) for achieving global serializability, as SS2PL does, any CO compliant database system or transactional object can transparently join existing SS2PL based environments, use 2PC, and maintain global serializability without any environment change. This makes CO a straightforward, natural generalization of SS2PL for any conflict serializability based database system, for all practical purposes.Commitment ordering has been quite widely known inside the transaction processing and databases communities at Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) since 1990. It has been under company confidentiality due to patentingprocesses. CO was disclosed outside of DEC by lectures and technical reports\' distribution to database researches in May 1991, immediately after its first patent filing. It has been misunderstood by many database researchers years after its introduction, which is evident by the quotes above from articles in 1997-1998 referencing Commitment ordering articles. On the other hand, CO has been utilized extensively as a solution for global serializability in works on Transactional processes,and more recently in the related Re:GRIDiT,which is an approach for transaction management in the converging Grid computing and Cloud computing.See more in The History of Commitment Ordering.Relaxing global serializability.While local (to a database system) relaxed serializability methods compromise serializability for performance gain (and are utilized only when the application can tolerate possible resulting inaccuracies, or its integrity is unharmed), it is unclear that various proposed relaxed global serializability methods which compromise global serializability, provide any performance gain over commitment ordering which guarantees global serializability. Typically, the declared intention of such methods has not been performance gain over effective global serializability methods (which apparently have been unknown to the inventors), but rather correctness criteria alternatives due to lack of a known effective global serializability method. Oddly, some of them were introduced years after CO had been introduced, and some even quote CO without realizing that it provides an effective global serializability solution, and thus without providing any performance comparison with CO to justify them as alternatives to global serializability for some applications (e.g., Two-level serializability). Two-level serializability is even presented as a major global concurrency control method in a 2010 edition of a text-book on databases (authored by two of the original authors of Two-level serializability, where one of them, Avi Silberschatz, is also an author of the original Strong recoverability articles). This book neither mentions CO nor references it, and strangely, apparently does not consider CO a valid Global serializability solution.Another common reason nowadays for Global serializability relaxation is the requirement of availability of internet products and services. This requirement is typically answered by large scale data replication. The straightforward solution for synchronizing replicas\' updates of a same database object is including all these updates in a single atomic distributed transaction. However, with many replicas such a transaction is very large, and may span several computers and networks that some of them are likely to be unavailable. Thus such a transaction is likely to end with abort and miss its purpose.Consequently, Optimistic replication (Lazy replication) is often utilized (e.g., in many products and services by Google, Amazon, Yahoo, and alike), while Global serializability is relaxed and compromised for Eventual consistency. In this case relaxation is done only for applications that are not expected to be harmed by it.Classes of schedules defined by relaxed global serializability properties either contain the global serializability class, or are incomparable with it. What differentiates techniques for relaxed global conflict serializability (RGCSR) properties from those of relaxed conflict serializability (RCSR) properties that are not RGCSR is typically the different way global cycles (span two or more databases) in the global conflict graph are handled. No distinction between global and local cycles exists for RCSR properties that are not RGCSR. RCSR contains RGCSR. Typically RGCSR techniques eliminate local cycles, i.e., provide local serializability (which can be achieved effectively by regular, known concurrency control methods), however, obviously they do not eliminate all global cycles (which would achieve global serializability).'),(2116680,'Sober_(Tool_song)','Sober (Tool song).Sober is a song by US rock band, Tool. The song was released as the second single from their debut album, Undertow.Tool guitarist Adam Jones has stated in an interview that the song is about a friend of the band whose artistic expression only comes out when he is under the influence. A lot of people give him shit for that, Jones explains. If you become addicted and a junkie, well, that\'s your fault.Writing.Sober is one of the earliest songs composed by Maynard James Keenan, with roots dating back to a 1987 live performance (released as Peace Day with his first band, Children of the Anachronistic Dynasty) in which the song was called Burn About Out. The song contains some lyrics from the first verse of Sober, with the same basic melody, although the melody is considerably faster and has an instrumental chorus.The song was recorded by MJK with Tool for the first time in mid-1991 on a demo tape titled 72826.Music video.A video for Sober was made in 1993. It debuted in May of that same year and was directed by Fred Stuhr. It was filmed using stop-motion animation, with the characters\' models designed by Adam Jones. It was the first of Tool\'s videos to be made in stop motion, the earlier promo video for Hush being live action and featuring all four band members. However, brief flashes of the musicians can be seen near the beginning, as well as a live-action figure twitching and vibrating violently.The video\'s protagonist is a small, humanoid being, who lives and sleeps in a rusty room sparsely decorated with a bed with no mattress and a curtain as a blanket, table and chair inside an abandoned mansion. He happens to stumble upon a wooden box, which he opens near the beginning. Its contents are kept hidden for the majority of the video\'s duration, but it seems whatever it is has had adverse mind altering effects - there are repeated shots of the humanoid levitating in his chair, and his head and arm vibrating wildly. While experiencing these effects, the figure ventures through his living quarters and its many corridors.The climax provides a barrage of imagery and revelations: a figure attached to a wall behind a translucent screen, a sentry of sorts wielding a mobile, robotic cannon and an organic substance flowing through a pipe found in the house. At the end, the box is empty, leaving the viewer to determine its meaning.'),(40946764,'2013_Singapore_cyberattacks','2013 Singapore cyberattacks.The 2013 Singapore cyberattacks were a series of hack attacks initiated by the hacktivist organisation Anonymous, represented by a member known by the online handle The Messiah. The cyber attacks were partly in response to web censorship regulations in the country, specifically on news outlets. On 12 November 2013, James Raj was charged in Singapore court as the alleged The Messiah.Background.On 1 June, a new set of web censorship regulations drafted by the Media Development Authority became effective in Singapore. Under the new rules, websites with at least 50,000 unique visitors from Singapore every month that publish at least one local news article per week over a period of two months... will have to remove \'prohibited content\' such as articles that undermine \'racial or religious harmony\' within 24 hours of being notified by Singapore\'s media regulator. During the introduction of these new rules, government officials stated that they do not impinge on internet freedom.Incidents.Following his hack attack on the People\'s Action Party\'s Community Foundation\'s webpage, Anonymous member The Messiah hacked into the official website of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council, to exemplify the fact that it was very vulnerable to cyber attacks. Site administrators were quick to lock the site and a police report was made.Upset with the Government\'s new licensing rules imposed on websites, a purported member of Anonymous went on to upload a four-minute-long video on YouTube, in which he, wearing the signature Guy Fawkes mask, threatened to bring down key infrastructure in Singapore. He also urged Singaporeans to don red and black on 5 November, as well as black out their Facebook profile pictures. In the video, he made reference to The Messiah, who he called one of [Anonymous\'] comrades.The Straits Times news reporter Irene Tham decided to post a critique of The Messiah\'s video on her blog on the newspaper\'s official website. The hacker then hit back by hacking into the blog, defacing the report\'s title with the words Dear ST [Straits Times]: You just got hacked for misleading the people!. In justification, The Messiah opined that Tham had misconstrued his speech. He also noted that Tham conveniently modif[ied] the sentence \'war against the Singapore government\' into \'war against Singapore\'. He enjoined Tham to either apologise within two days or resign from her job, to atone for her blasphemous lies.Later on, in an email to Yahoo Singapore, The Messiah said we reached out to our comrades from other fractions [sic] who together with us performed DNS poisoning on the.gov.sg sites, taking them down for a period of time. But there must have also been some patching that was done as some of our favourite point of entries into their networks seemed to be fixed.On 3 November, the website of the Seletar Airport was hacked. Its webpage replaced with a black and green background with an image in the middle resembling a skull wearing a hood. The site resumed normal operations 30 minutes after the hack was first noticed.On 5 November, the Twitter and YouTube accounts of Singaporean entertainer Ridhwan Azman were hacked. According to posts from the compromised account, this was in retaliation for dissing the legion. Apart from this incident, Anonymous did not carry out any other major activity, contrary to its promise to ignite a massive protest on that date.Two days later, the hacktivists hacked into and vandalised a subpage on the website of Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, following Lee\'s vow to bring The Messiah and his accomplices to justice. Additionally, the webpage of the Istana was also hacked.On 20 November, the websites of 13 schools, which were hosted on a single server, were reportedly defaced between 3:30pm to 5pm.Reception.News of the cyberattacks were picked up by disparate news outlets from around the world, including the South China Morning Post, The Huffington Post, Time, The Star, and The Jakarta Post, among others.Regarding the hacking of the Ang Mo Kio Town Council\'s website, Member of Parliament Ang Hin Kee dubbed it as malicious, promising to boost the page\'s security system.After the release of the YouTube video, the Government IT Security Incident Response Team immediately released an alert to all the Singaporean government agencies. The Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore responded in an official statement, We are aware of the video, and the police are investigating the matter. The Singapore Press Holdings (SPH), of which The Straits Times is a subsidiary, promptly took down the blog which was hacked into and filed a complaint to the police.Singaporean politician and Deputy Chairman of Singapore\'s Parliamentary Committee for Communications and Information, Baey Yam Keng, offered, We do not know what the hacker\'s capabilities are, so it\'s important for us to take this very seriously. Bertha Henson, who operates Breakfast Network, a Singaporean news outlet, felt that The Messiah\'s action would make the government seem right, that we [independent website operators] are just troublemakers.Whilst observing counter-terrorism drill Exercise Highcrest, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong pledged to hunt down the team responsible for the cyberattack, stating, It is not a laughing matter. It\'s not just anything goes, and you\'re anonymous, therefore there\'s no responsibility. You may think you are anonymous. We will make that extra effort to find out who you are.'),(3458232,'John_Judis','John Judis.John B.

He was formally a player, playing as a shooting guard.Esposito is most notable internationally for being the first player signed by the Toronto Raptors of the NBA, also making him the first Italian signed by an NBA team.The majority of his career took place in Italy, where he was named Serie A MVP in 1999 and 2000, having earlier won the league with Juvecaserta in 1991.Early career.The Caserta native started his career with hometown club Juvecaserta Basket during the 1984-85 Serie A season, at only 15.With the Campanian club he would win the 1988 Italian Basketball Cup and the 1990-91 Serie A championship, the club\'s first (and as of 2015 only) national championship, during that time the team also played in the 199192 FIBA European League and the 199293 FIBA Kora Cup.Esposito would move on to Fortitudo Bologna in 1993, playing there for two years.Toronto Raptors.Esposito had been noticed by NBA teams, the Cleveland Cavaliers through scout Rudy D\'Amico and the Toronto Raptors through Bob Zuffelato. Though he had agreed terms with the Cavaliers, complications related to the NBA lockout meant he could only sign with the Raptors.When he signed a multi-year deal on 25 May 1995, he was the first player ever signed by the Canadian expansion team (predating the expansion draft and 1995 NBA draft by a month).Though Esposito wasn\'t the first Italian to play in an NBA game  preceded by Stefano Rusconi by three days  he was the first to score, on a free throw in a 15 November game against the Houston Rockets.He rarely played during the Raptor\'s 21-61 season, with 30 games played, for an average of 3.9 points and 0.8 assists, in 9.4 minutes.His best performance was 18 points, 2 assists, 2 offensive rebounds, and 2 turnovers, in 30 minutes, during a 6 April 1996 loss to the New York Knicks in Madison Square Garden.Return to Europe.Despite having two years left on his contract, and amidst talks of a trade to the Philadelphia 76ers, Esposito returned to Italy to sign with Scavolini Pesaro in the summer of 1996.Penning a contract reportedly worth at least 1 billion lire net annually (more than 500,000 in euros today), Esposito was acclaimed as a star on his return. However, Pesaro struggled in the league, barely escaping relegation in the 1996-97 season, and Esposito felt he was being singled out for the team\'s shortcomings. The club and the player agreed to a buyout in November 1997, with the player moving to Mabo Pistoia.He joined Andrea Costa Imola after the 1997-98 season, and there he would regain his top form, by top-scoring in the league for three consecutive years, whilst being twice designated as league MVP, in 1999 and 2000, and also All Star Game MVP in 1998.He moved to Snaidero Udine in 2001, but he only stayed until January 2002, before having another foray abroad, in the Spanish Liga ACB with Telecom Gran Canaria, where he finished the season. He impressed in Spain by scoring more than 20 points on average, including 45 in an April game against Valladolid that assuaged relegation fears.Later years.He returned to Imola, now of the second division Legadue, in 2002, staying there one year, before moving to fellow Legadue team Scafati Basket in 2003.Esposito stayed there until February 2004, when the nearly 35-year-old returned to the Serie A with Lottomatica Roma, to provide more depth to an injury-struck squad. He played less than usual, and finished with 3.5 points on average in the league, also scoring 14 in his first (and last) career Euroleague game, against Pau-Orthez.He returned to Imola, still in Legadue, for the 2004-05 season, with a brief stay in the Spanish second division LEB playoffs with Polaris World Murcia.Another return to Legadue followed in 2005, with Casale Monferrato, where he stayed until February 2006, as he signed with Capo d\'Orlando for his last Serie A season.After being released in October 2006, he joined the third division Serie B1 club Gragnano later that season.He signed with another Serie B1 side, Gira Ozzano, staying there for two years, before ending his playing career in 2009, at 40 years old.Esposito finished his 25 year playing career with 762 games played, across all teams and divisions, with 13,286 points scored, for an average of 17.43 points per game.Coaching career.After his retirement, Esposito started a coaching career with Aquila Basket Trento of the Serie A Dilettanti (the renamed third division) for the 2009-10 season, with the team finishing ninth.The next year, he coached Fortitudo Agrigento of the same division, leaving after a year that saw the side relegated.In July 2013, he returned to Imola, to coach the side that was still in the second division (now DNA Gold), after his side only won 1 game in 13, he decided - at 44 - to return to the side as player, leaving coaching duties to his assistant.He rejoined another former club, Juvecaserta, in 2014, to serve as assistant coach to Zare Markovski in the Serie A. When Markovski was dismissed in December, with Caserta at zero points in the league standings, Esposito took over as head coach. He helped them to 8 wins in the next 19 games, which gave them hope of escaping relegation, however the side lost their final game and were unable to achieve safety.Esposito would stay in the Serie A, signing a two-year deal with Giorgio Tesi Group Pistoia in June 2015.International career.Esposito played for the youth national teams of Italy, playing in the 1985 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship, where he won a bronze medal, and the 1988 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, where he top scored for Italy, as they lost in the final.He later joined the senior men\'s Italian national basketball team for EuroBasket 1995, where Italy made it to the quarterfinals.Though he played in the qualifiers for EuroBasket 1997, he would not make the squad for the main tournament.

The kingdom suffered a first French invasion in 1796, which led to the Treaty of Paris and the loss of Savoy and Nice. After a second invasion in 1798, King Charles Emmanuel IV escaped to Rome, but he never agreed to sign a new peace treaty, approving a final arrangement of its continental territories according to international law.The Piedmontese Republic was declared on 10 September 1798 and it existed until 20 June 1799, when it was conquered by Austro-Russian troops. Although the Kingdom of Sardinia\'s authority was briefly restored in Piedmont, in 1800 Napoleon returned to Italy, taking back much of the new republics. The Piedmontese Republic was re-established as the Subalpine Republic on 20 June 1800.The republic had its capital at Turin. On 9 July 1800, it adopted a new flag, which consisted of a red-blue-gold triband (based on the flag of the earlier Republic of Alba). Its motto was Libert, galit, which was taken from the French motto Libert, galit, fraternit.Paris introduced French-style reforms within the Subalpine Republic. It used the French franc, and also minted its own coins.In March 1801, the Piedmontese Army was incorporated into the French Army, and a few months later the administrative management of the region ended up completely in French hands. On 4 June 1802, Charles Emmanuel abdicated in favour of his brother Victor Emmanuel I, who was in Cagliari under British naval protection. Napoleon took this opportunity to declare the forfeiture of the old sovereignty over Piedmont, and plans were made to annex it to France.The Subalpine Republic ceased to exist on 11 September 1802, when it was divided between the French and Italian Republics. The French Republic annexed the dpartements of Doire, Marengo, P (briefly named ridan, after Eridanos), Sesia, Stura, and Tanaro, while the Italian Republic annexed Novara (as the department of Agogna). In 1805, the Italian Republic became the Kingdom of Italy.'),(3681383,'Tracking_(hunting)','Tracking (hunting).Tracking in hunting and ecology is the science and art of observing animal tracks and other signs, with the goal of gaining understanding of the landscape and the animal being tracked (quarry). A further goal of tracking is the deeper understanding of the systems and patterns that make up the environment surrounding and incorporating the tracker.The practice of tracking may focus on, but is not limited to, the patterns and systems of the local animal life and ecology. Trackers must be able to recognize and follow animals through their tracks, signs, and trails, also known as spoor. Spoor may include tracks, scat, feathers, kills, scratching posts, trails, drag marks, sounds, scents, marking posts, the behavior of other animals, habitat cues, and any other clues about the identity and whereabouts of the quarry.The skilled tracker is able to discern these clues, recreate what transpired on the landscape, and make predictions about the quarry. The tracker may attempt to predict the current location of the quarry and follow the quarry\'s spoor to that location, in an activity known as trailing.Prehistoric hunters used tracking principally to gather food. Even in historic times, tracking has been traditionally practiced by the majority of tribal people all across the world. The military and intelligence agencies also use tracking to find enemy combatants in the bush, land, sea, and desert.Tracking as an art and science.It has been suggested that the art of tracking may have been the first implementation of science (Liebenberg, 1990; Liebenberg, 2006; Carruthers, 2002; Carruthers, 2006; Pickering and Bunn, 2007), practiced by hunter-gatherers since the evolution of modern humans.Apart from knowledge based on direct observations of animals, trackers gain a detailed understanding of animal behavior through the interpretation of tracks and signs. In this way much information can be obtained that would otherwise remain unknown, especially on the behavior of rare or nocturnal animals that are not often seen.Tracks and signs offer information on undisturbed, natural behavior, while direct observations often influence the animal by the mere presence of the observer. Tracking is therefore a non-invasive method of information gathering, in which potential stress caused to animals can be minimized.Some of the most important applications of tracking are in hunting and trapping, as well as controlling poaching, ecotourism, environmental education, police investigation, search and rescue, and in scientific research.The modern science of animal tracking is widely practiced in the fields of wildlife biology, zoology, mammalogy, conservation, and wildlife management. Tracking enables the detection of rare, endangered, and elusive species. The science of tracking is utilized in the study of forest carnivores like the Canada Lynx, (Felis lynx), and the Wolverine, (Gulo gulo). Various measurements of tracks, and/or an animal\'s paws, and subsequent analyses of the datum, can also reveal important information about animals\' physiology and their behavior. For example, measurements of Lynx paws demonstrate their support capacity (on snow) to be double that of bobcat (Parker et al., 1983) (see U.S.D.A, Forest Service, GTR RM-254, pg. 93)Recognition of signs.In order to recognize a specific sign, a tracker often has a preconceived image of what a typical sign looks like. Without preconceived images many signs may be overlooked. However, with a preconceived image of a specific animal\'s spoor in mind, trackers will tend to \'recognize\' spoor in markings made by another animal, or even in random markings (Liebenberg, 1990). Their mind will be prejudiced to see what they want to see, and in order to avoid making such errors they must be careful not to reach decisions too soon. Decisions made at a glance can often be erroneous, so when encountering new signs, trackers take their time to study signs in detail. While preconceived images may help in recognizing signs, the tracker must, however, avoid the preconditioned tendency to look for one set of things in the environment to the exclusion of all others.Trackers will always try to identify the trail positively by some distinguishing mark or mannerism in order not to lose it in any similar spoor. They will look for such features in the footprints as well as for an individual manner of walking. Often hoofs of antelope are broken or have chipped edges, or when the animal is walking it may leave a characteristic scuffmark. Experienced trackers will memorise a spoor and be able to distinguish that individual animal\'s spoor from others. When following a spoor, trackers will walk next to it, not on it, taking care not to spoil the trail so that it can easily be found again if the spoor is lost.The shadows cast by ridges in the spoor show up best if the spoor is kept between the tracker and the sun. With the sun shining from behind the spoor, the shadows cast by small ridges and indentations in the spoor will be clearly visible. With the sun behind the tracker, however, these shadows will be hidden by the ridges that cast them. Tracking is easiest in the morning and late afternoon, as the shadows cast by the ridges in the spoor are longer and stand out better than at or near midday. As the sun moves higher in the sky, the shadows grow shorter. At midday the spoor may cast no shadows at all, making them difficult to see in the glare of the sunlight.Trackers will never look down at their feet if they can help it, since this will slow them down. By looking up, well ahead of themselves, approximately five to ten meters (1530 feet) depending on the terrain, they are able to track much faster and with more ease. Unless they need to study the spoor more closely, it is not necessary to examine every sign. If they see a sign ten meters ahead, those in between can be ignored while they look for spoor further on. Over difficult terrain it may not be possible to see signs well ahead, so trackers will have to look at the ground in front of them and move more slowly.Trackers must also avoid concentrating all their attention on the tracks, thereby ignoring everything around them. Tracking requires varying attention, a constant refocusing between minute details of the track and the whole pattern of the environment.Anticipation and prediction.Although in principle it is possible to follow a trail by simply looking for one sign after the other, this may prove so time-consuming that the tracker will never catch up with the quarry. Instead, trackers place themselves in the position of their quarry in order to anticipate the route it may have taken (Liebenberg, 1990). They will thereby be able to decide in advance where they can expect to find signs and thus not waste time looking for them.Trackers will often look for spoor in obvious places such as openings between bushes, where the animal would most likely have moved. In thick bushes they will look for the most accessible throughways. Where the spoor crosses an open clearing, they will look in the general direction for access ways on the other side of the clearing. If the animal was moving from shade to shade, they will look for spoor in the shade ahead. If their quarry has consistently moved in a general direction, it may be possible to follow the most likely route by focusing on the terrain, and to look for signs of spoor only occasionally. They must, however, always be alert for an abrupt change in direction.Animals usually make use of a network of paths to move from one locality to another. If it is clear that an animal was using a particular path, this can simply be followed up to the point where it forks, or to where the animal has left the path. Where one of several paths may have been used, trackers must of course determine which path that specific animal used. This may not always be easy, since many animals often use the same paths.In areas of high animal densities that have much-used animal paths which interlink, it may seem impossible to follow tracks. However, once tracks have been located on an animal path, it is often possible for a tracker to follow the path even though no further tracks are seen. By looking to either side of the path, the tracker can establish if the animal has moved away from the path, and then follow the new trail.In difficult terrain, where signs are sparse, trackers may have to rely extensively on anticipating the animal\'s movements. In order to move fast enough to overtake the animal, one may not be able to detect all the signs. Trackers sometimes identify themselves with the animal to such an extent that they follow an imaginary route which they think the animal would most likely have taken, only confirming their expectations with occasional signs (Liebenberg, 1990).When trackers come to hard, stony ground, where tracks are virtually impossible to discern, apart from the odd small pebble that has been overturned, they may move around the patch of hard ground in order to find the spoor in softer ground.When the trackers lose the spoor, they first search obvious places for signs, choosing several likely access ways through the bush in the general direction of movement. When several trackers work together, they can simply fan out and quarter the ground until one of them finds it. An experienced tracker may be able to predict more or less where the animal was going, and will not waste time in one spot looking for signs, but rather look for it further ahead (Liebenberg, 1990).Knowledge of the terrain and animal behavior allows trackers to save valuable time by predicting the animal\'s movements. Once the general direction of movement is established and it is known that an animal path, river or any other natural boundary lies ahead, they can leave the spoor and move to these places, cutting across the trail by sweeping back and forth across the predicted direction in order to pick up tracks a considerable distance ahead (Liebenberg, 1990).To be able to anticipate and predict the movements of an animal, trackers must know the animal and its environment so well that they can identify themselves with that animal. They must be able to visualize how the animal was moving around, and place themselves in its position.If the animal was moving in a straight line at a steady pace, and it is known that there is a waterhole or a pan further ahead, trackers should leave the spoor to look for signs of it at the waterhole or pan. While feeding, an animal will usually move into the wind, going from one bush to another. If the trackers know the animal\'s favored food, and know moreover how they generally move, they need not follow its zigzag path, but leave the spoor at places, moving in a straight course to save time, and pick up the spoor further on (Liebenberg, 1990).Since signs may be fractional or partly obliterated, it may not always be possible to make a complete reconstruction of the animal\'s movements and activities on the basis of spoor evidence alone. Trackers may therefore have to create a working hypothesis in which spoor evidence is supplemented with hypothetical assumptions based not only on their knowledge of animal behavior, but also on their creative ability to solve new problems and discover new information. The working hypothesis is often a reconstruction of what the animal was doing, how fast it was moving, when it was there, where it was going to and where it might be at that time. Such a working hypothesis enables the trackers to predict the animal\'s movements. As new information is gathered, they may have to revise their working hypothesis, creating a better reconstruction of the animal\'s activities. Anticipating and predicting an animal\'s movements, therefore, involves a continuous process of problem-solving, creating new hypotheses and discovering new information (Liebenberg, 1990).Stealth.In order to come close to an animal, trackers must remain undetected not only by the animal, but also by other animals that may alert it. Moving as quietly as possible, trackers will avoid stepping on dry leaves and twigs, and take great care when moving through dry grass.If the trackers are in close proximity to the animal, it is important that they remain downwind of it, that is, in a position where the wind is blowing away from the animal in the direction of the tracker. They must never be in a position where their scent could be carried in the wind towards the animal and thereby alert it. It is also important that the animal does not have the opportunity to cross their tracks, since the lingering human scent will alert it. Most animals prefer to keep the wind in their faces when traveling so that they can scent danger ahead of them. Trackers will therefore usually be downwind from them as they approach the animals from behind. The wind direction may, however, have changed. If the wind direction is unfavorable, the trackers may have to leave the spoor to search for their quarry from the downwind side (Liebenberg, 1990).As the trackers get closer to the animal, they must make sure that they see it before it sees them. Some trackers maintain that an animal keeps looking back down its own trail, always on the alert for danger coming from behind. When the spoor is very fresh, trackers may have to leave the spoor so that the animal does not see them first. Animals usually rest facing downwind, so that they can see danger approaching from the downwind side, while they can smell danger coming from behind them. An animal may also double back on its spoor and circle downwind before settling down to rest (Liebenberg, 1990). A predator following its trail will move past the resting animal on the upwind side before realizing that the animal had doubled back, and the resting animal will smell the predator in time to make its escape.When stalking an animal, trackers use the cover of bushes, going down on their hands and knees where necessary. In long grass they go down on their stomachs pulling themselves forward with their elbows. A cardboard box placed over the tracker whilst on all fours offers the best method of staying hidden. The most important thing is not to attract attention by sudden movements. Trackers take their time, moving slowly when the animal is not looking, and keeping still when the animal is looking in their direction. When stalking an animal, trackers must also be careful not to disturb other animals. A disturbed animal will give its alarm signal, thereby alerting all animals in the vicinity, including the animal being tracked down.'),(30108776,'Bernard_Gray','Bernard Gray.Sir Bernard Peter Gray (born 6 September 1960 at Redhill, Surrey, UK) is a British businessman and journalist.

Held annually, the Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames. In a race umpired by former Cambridge rower Kenneth Payne, Oxford won by a canvas in a time of 20 minutes 23 seconds. At no point during the contest was there clear water between the boats. The race, described as one of the closest fought of all time, was their second win in seven years and took the overall record in the event to 5344 in Cambridge\'s favour.Background.The Boat Race is a side-by-side rowing competition between the University of Oxford (sometimes referred to as the Dark Blues) and the University of Cambridge (sometimes referred to as the Light Blues). First held in 1829, the race takes place on the Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London. The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and, as of 2014, broadcast worldwide. Cambridge went into the race as reigning champions, having won the 1951 race by a three-and-a-half lengths, and had won the previous five races. They led overall with 53 victories to Oxford\'s 43 (excluding the dead heat of 1877).Oxford\'s coaches were A. J. M. Durand (who had rowed for the Dark Blues in the 1920 race), Hugh Jumbo Edwards (who rowed for Oxford in 1926 and 1930), R. D. Hill (who rowed in the 1940 wartime race) and J. H. Page. Cambridge were coached by C. B. M. Lloyd (three-time Blue between 1949 and 1951), Roy Meldrum (a coach for Lady Margaret Boat Club), James Owen and Harold Rickett (who rowed three times between 1930 and 1932). The race was umpired for the third time by the former British Olympian Kenneth Payne, who had rowed for Cambridge in the 1932 and 1934 races.Although Cambridge had arrived at Putney as clear favourites to win, Oxford\'s improvements during the build-up to the race had shortened their odds: as the rowing correspondent in The Manchester Guardian suggested, anything might happen. The rowing correspondent for the The Times reported that Cambridge were quoted as even but would still start [the] race as favourites. Moreover, the crews were extraordinarily evenly matched, but Oxford have a very good chance of breaking the run of Cambridge wins.Crews.The Cambridge crew weighed an average of 12st 11.5lb (81.2kg), per rower more than their opponents. Oxford\'s crew contained three rowers with Boat Race experience including their stroke Chris Davidge who was making his third appearance in the event. Cambridge saw three participants return, including cox John Hinde. Oxford\'s number six Ken Keniston was the only participant registered as non-British; the former Harvard University rower was from the United States.Race.Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Middlesex station, handing the Surrey side of the river to Oxford. The weather was inclement, with gale-force winds and snow disrupting the race, and limiting the number of spectators lining the banks of the Thames to a few thousand. Umpire Payne started the race at 3:15p.m. Cambridge made the cleaner start in the rough conditions, and held a quarter-length lead at the Dukes\' Head pub. Despite making a number of spurts, the Light Blues could not pull away from Oxford, the Dark Blues\' stroke maintaining a higher stroke rate to keep in touch. Keeping to more sheltered conditions yet in slower water, Cambridge passed the Mile Post with a lead of half a length.With the bend in the river beginning to favour Oxford, the lead was slowly eroded until both boats passed nearly level below Hammersmith Bridge. Alongside Chiswick Eyot, the Dark Blues were almost half-a-length ahead but not gaining further. Cambridge\'s cox Hinde pushed the Oxford boat towards the centre of the river and as they passed under Barnes Bridge the Dark Blue lead was down to less than a quarter of a length. Oxford won by a canvas (approximately) in a time of 20 minutes 23 seconds, the narrowest margin of victory since 1877, and their first win in six attempts. At no point during the course of the race did either boat have a clear water advantage over their opponent. The rowing correspondent for The Manchester Guardian described the race as one of the closest fought of all time, while Ian Thomson, writing in The Observer suggested it was one of the most exciting races ever rowed.'),(19108985,'Rigger_(entertainment)','Rigger (entertainment).A rigger is one who works on ropes, booms, lifts, hoists and the like for a stage production (film, theater, live music, etc.).The term rigger originally referred to a person who attended to the rigging of a sailing ship. In the age of sail, trading followed seasonal patterns with ships leaving port at set times of the year to make the most of winds. When not at sea sailors would seek employment ashore. Their skill with ropes and booms found use in the theatre.The original canvas backdrops used in the theatre moved with ropes and pulleys, being developed from techniques used for sails. It is from these roots that modern fly systems emerged. This also gave rise to the tradition in British theatres of never whistling on stage as the riggers would use the same whistled instructions on stage as they did aboard ship. A misplaced whistle could be taken as an instruction to the riggers to change the set.The term rigger is still used for people backstage in theatres, the road crew for a live concert, conventions and trade shows, and by extension to similar jobs such as those who are responsible for fastening chain motors (like CM Lodestar) by wire rope to the structural steel of a building.With the birth of the film industry, just as stage actors adapted their techniques to the new medium so did those back stage. The complexity of the new environment giving rise to specializations such as those in the film industry who rig scaffolding for film sets and camera rigs; also termed as a standby rigger if they are on site and \'on call\' all of the time.Wire riggers.In the theater and film industry, a wire rigger is a worker in the special effects/stunts film crew who flies actors. They are responsible for rigging special harnesses to attached wires which in turn are run through a series of blocks (pulleys) to a control area where a wire rigger raises, lowers or traverses an actor wearing the harness. Wire riggers also rig up rails along which travels a skate from which the wire is attached. Many plays and feature films (e.g. Peter Pan, Harry Potter, Superman) use this technique.'),(416890,'Chris_Coleman_(footballer)','Chris Coleman (footballer).Christopher Patrick Chris Coleman (born 10 June 1970) is a Welsh professional football manager and former player who is the current manager of the Wales national team.As a player, Coleman usually played in defence, while also occasionally appearing as a forward. He won 32 caps playing for Wales. Coleman\'s playing career ended at the age of 32, when his leg was broken in a car crash. Following this, he started his coaching career.In his first full season as manager of Fulham, Coleman guided the club to ninth place in the 200304 Premier League. After leaving Fulham, Coleman was appointed manager of Real Sociedad, where he resigned in January 2008 due to differences with the incoming president. He returned to England to manage Coventry City, but was dismissed in May 2010 following a poor run of results. Coleman then managed Greek side Larissa for the first half of the 201112 season before resigning due to financial troubles at the club. In 2012, he took over as Welsh national manager after the death of Gary Speed, and led Wales to UEFA Euro 2016, their first major tournament since the 1958 FIFA World Cup.Personal life.Coleman was born in Swansea to a family of two sisters. He started school at St Joseph\'s Roman Catholic Primary School and then went to Bishop Vaughan RC School. As a child, he grew up a keen supporter of Liverpool  his favourite player being Emlyn Hughes. The first professional team he was contracted to was Manchester City, aged 16, although he later left them, citing homesickness as the major reason. He then joined Swansea.He is married to TV presenter Charlotte Jackson. They had a son at the end of 2014. His oldest son Sonny is a football agent.In June 2010, Coleman worked as a commentator for ITV at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He has also worked as a commentator and pundit for Sky Sports.Swansea City.Coleman made his first professional appearance for his hometown club Swansea City aged 17, in the autumn of 1987, soon after joining them from Manchester City. He made nearly 200 appearances for the south Wales club and helped win the Welsh Cup in 1989 and 1991.Crystal Palace.After spending four years with Swansea, Coleman was signed by Crystal Palace in 1991 for a transfer fee set by a Football League tribunal at around 270,000, plus a percentage of any future sale. After making 143 appearances, scoring 16 goals in that period  a 1 in 9 record explained by the fact that manager Steve Coppell often used Coleman as a makeshift centre forward. Palace finished 10th in Coleman\'s first season at Selhurst Park, but they were relegated from the new FA Premier League in his second season (although they did reach the semi-finals of the League Cup). They won promotion as Division One champions at the first attempt, but went straight back down again despite reaching the semi-finals of both cups that season. Coleman was sold to Blackburn Rovers, the defending league champions, for 2.8million in December 1995. While at Palace, he was capped for Wales at senior level for the first time.In 2005, Palace supporters voted Coleman into their Centenary XI.Blackburn Rovers.Coleman joined Premier League champions Blackburn Rovers for a fee of 2.8 million. Blackburn did not retain the Premier League title they had won in 1995, and finished seventh, just missing out on a UEFA Cup place. Coleman made 28 league appearances over his season-and-a-half at the club, and when he found himself out of the starting line-up too often (not helped by a persistent Achilles injury), he took the gamble to further his career by dropping two divisions to join Fulham.Fulham.Fulham, at the time in Division Two, were financed by wealthy businessman Mohamed Al-Fayed, and were able to spend a record transfer fee for the division and club, of over 2 million for Coleman in late 1997. He quickly became club captain, and led Fulham to promotion under manager Kevin Keegan in 199899 to the First Division.He remained captain and a regular in the team under new manager Jean Tigana in the 200001 season as Fulham made a successful start to the campaign. However, Coleman\'s career was effectively ended midway through the season, after he broke his leg in a car crash, near Bletchingley in Surrey on 2 January 2001, just days before an FA Cup tie against Manchester United. He never recovered from this injury despite playing a reserve fixture in March 2002, a game that only served as an indication that he would never again play at the highest level of English football. He announcement his retirement as a player in October 2002, but stayed at the West London club as a member of the coaching staff.International career.Coleman was capped by Wales at school, youth, under-21 and senior levels. His only competitive football appearance after his leg injuries came for Wales on 14 May 2002, when he was called up to the squad as a replacement for Danny Gabbidon, and then came on as a late substitute for goalscorer Robert Earnshaw in the 10 win over Germany at the Millennium Stadium.Fulham.Coleman joined Fulham\'s coaching staff in October 2002 under Tigana. He later succeeded the Frenchman as caretaker manager in April 2003, and steered Fulham away from relegation danger. He was named as Fulham\'s permanent manager in May 2003, beating the more experienced Klaus Toppmller and George Burley to the post, and also became the youngest manager in the Premier League.His first full season in charge saw Fulham finish a surprise ninth place, as many pundits tipped them to struggle and for Coleman to be sacked. Many of Fulham\'s key players, such as Edwin van der Sar, Louis Saha, Steed Malbranque and Luis Boa Morte, were sold in the following years and Fulham did not repeat their earlier successes under Coleman though he kept them clear of relegation. He was sacked on 10 April 2007, after Fulham went on a seven-game winless run.Real Sociedad.Coleman moved abroad to manage recently relegated Segunda Divisin side Real Sociedad on 28 June 2007, after being recommended to the club by fellow Welshman and former Real Sociedad manager John Toshack. He was linked with Bolton Wanderers in October 2007though nothing came of it. With the club in 5th place and having only lost once in its previous eleven games, Coleman resigned as manager on 16 January 2008, citing a divergence in vision for the club with newly elected President Iaki Badiola.Coventry City.Coleman was appointed manager of Championship side Coventry City on 19 February 2008, signing a three-and-a-half-year contract. He replaced Iain Dowie, who had been sacked by new owner Ray Ranson.On 26 August 2008, the BBC reported that Coleman was no longer interested in the international success of Wales. He later denied the allegation, however, telling BBC Radio Wales\' Sportstime programme, I\'ve got to get him [Eastwood] fit for Coventry first and foremost, that\'s my job. When he is fit, I\'d drive him down the motorway myself if I had to for him to play for Wales. I\'ve played for Wales myself and I preferred playing for my country than any club I\'ve played for. I can promise you that I love Wales, I\'m very patriotic and that will never change. On 4 May 2010, Coleman was sacked following Coventry\'s 19th-place finish during the 200910 season, their lowest league finish in more than 45 years.Larissa.On 26 May 2011, Coleman was appointed as manager of Greek side Larissa. In January 2012, Coleman announced that because of financial troubles at the club he would be quitting from his position as manager.Wales.On 19 January 2012, Coleman was appointed team manager of the Wales national team, as successor to his friend Gary Speed, who had died the previous November. After letting his assistant Osian Roberts take charge in Speed\'s memorial match against in February, his first game in charge was a 20 defeat against Mexico at the MetLife Stadium in New Jersey on 27 May; Gareth Bale and Joe Ledley both missed the game through injury, but Craig Bellamy appeared, having previously made a decision to retire from international football.Wales\' first match in 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification was on 7 September at home to Belgium, with centre back James Collins sent off for a late lunge on Guillaume Gillet in the 25th minute of an eventual 02 loss. Four days later in Novi Sad, the team lost 61 to Serbia; Coleman said in October 2015 that he considered leaving his post after the defeat. After becoming the first Welsh manager to lose his first five games, Coleman got his first win on 12 October 2012, a 21 victory against from two Bale goals.

The publication was originally a website devoted to hip hop, until Lazerine decided to pitch the possibility of a magazine to several publishers. The magazine is focused on the hip hop and R&B aspect of the music industry, and predominantly features interviews with artists, actors and other entertainers. Issued quarterly, the magazine\'s target audience was the 14 to 28 demographic, although the demographic has become older over time.The magazine\'s first two issues were one time deals, although Lazerine and his brother Cameron received attention for their age and white background. The magazine restarted publication in 2005, when it managed to sell enough copies to ensure future releases. The magazine is sold in more than 20 countries, and a separate handbook has been released, chronicling the history of hip hop. The magazine has been nominated for two awards, and is often referenced by other magazines.History.Rap-Up was founded by Devin Lazerine when he was 15 years old as an after-school hobby; the magazine was an online compendium of hip hop news, gossip and top-ten music lists. After listening to the song Insane in the Brain by Cypress Hill at the age of 10, he wanted to be in the music industry but wasn\'t able to sing or rap, so that wasn\'t an option. Several days after launching the website, Devin decided to pitch the idea of a magazine to select publishers; the next day, a publisher from H&S Media expressed interest in the concept. Devin worked with his brother Cameron to create the magazine, and decided it would be for a young audience, in particular the 14 to 28 demographic. The magazine\'s first issue was published by H&S Media in July 2001; however, the company went bankrupt shortly after publishing the first issue, which sold 200,000 copies. Rap-Up was resurrected in 2003 by Total Media Group as an insert in the magazine Urban Teen Scene. The insert attracted media attentionmainly because of the brothers\' age and racein USA Today and The Los Angeles Times.The brothers began working on a third issue in 2004, without the backing of a publishing company. The largest advertisers were ring tone providers, while others included the Navy, clothing labels, videogames, Sony, Black Entertainment Television and Reebok. The editorials were written by 10 journalism students, and the photos were contributed by publicists. Art director Ian Lynam, who designed the magazine, sent everything online from Japan. The issue was released in March 2005, and cost $35,000 to produce. It featured singer Chingy on the cover, and 80,000 copies were distributed around the world. Beginning with the eleventh issue, which was published in summer 2008, Lynam redesigned the magazine\'s cover and contents. The main reason for the redesign was the change from a younger target audience to an older and more sophisticated one. Lynam felt the facelift imbue[d] it with a more demure and cosmopolitan aesthetic.The magazine is not audited, and is sold in more than 20 countries. In the U.S., the magazine is sold by Wal-Mart, Barnes & Noble, Borders Group and Tower Records. Devin calls Rap-Up a magazine for Generation Y by Generation Y. He serves as a writer, publisher and editor in chief, and oversees editorial content and advertising sales. Cameron works as publisher and assistant editor, and is in charge of printing, production, distribution and shipping of the magazine. In 2008, the magazine released a handbook entitled, Rap-Up: The Ultimate Guide to Hip-Hop and R&B, which was published by Hachette Book Group. The book chronicles the history of hip hop, and features a foreword by rapper T.I..Impact.Bob Baker, the former publisher of H&S Media, praised Devin for having the gumption to seek out publishers, to say \'I want to do this and how do I do it?\' I focus more on his age than his race. Lou Pitt, a manager and producer of film and television, found that Rap-Up stood out from magazines Vibe, The Source and XXL by showing the mainstream side of performers. Pitt said that the magazine is not the street version [...] It has a very populist approach, in the way of People magazine or Entertainment Weekly. In 2003, Devin was included on Fast Companys list of Champions of Innovation whose achievements are changing companies and our culture.

Along with St. Andrew\'s First Aid in Scotland and St John Ambulance in Wales, St John Ambulance is one of three affiliates of the international St. John Ambulance movement in the United Kingdom. The organisation is a subsidiary charity of the Priory of England and the Islands of the Venerable Order of St John which also oversees similar activities in Northern Ireland, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands.History.The St John Ambulance Association was set up in 1877 by the Venerable Order of Saint John to teach industrial workers first aid, so that they could provide on-the-spot treatment in emergencies. Workers rarely had ready access to a doctor in 19th century workplaces, and since accidents were frequent, death or disability from injuries were common. The St John Ambulance Association set up training sessions across the country, particularly in workplaces in areas of heavy industry, but also in villages, seaside towns and suburban areas.In 1887, trained volunteers were organised into a uniformed Brigade to provide a first aid and ambulance service at public events. In many parts of England (and in parts of Scotland, until 1908), St John Ambulance was the first and only provider of an ambulance service right up to the middle of the 20th century, when the National Health Service was founded. When there were far fewer doctors and hospital beds than today, St John Ambulance nurses looked after the sick and injured in their own homes.The St John Ambulance Brigade and St John Ambulance Association merged in 1968 to form St John Ambulance, a single organisation providing both training and first aid cover.During 2013, St John Ambulance trained approximately 278,000 adults through its workplace and community first aid programmes, and directly trained 91,000 schoolchildren. St John Ambulance personnel attended 45,000 public events, treating approximately 102,000 individuals. It also distributed 100,000 free first aid guides nationwide and its free smartphone app was downloaded by 148,000 people.First aid cover at events.St John Ambulance provides first aid cover at thousands of events every year. This service is provided free at the point of delivery, although a charge may be made to the event organiser for provision of the service at their event.In addition to providing volunteer first aiders for events, where necessary St John Ambulance can provide paramedics, doctors, nurses and cycle responders, as well as mobile treatment centres, ambulances and other medical provision.The organisation covers many major events across England including the London Marathon, V Festival and Hyde Park concerts, as well as smaller and charitable events such as fetes and local fairs.Training.St John Ambulance runs courses in first aid and health and safety for members of the public, training 254,000 people in 2013. Its First aid at work course is used by many companies to train designated individuals as first-aiders, as required by employment laws; specialist training is also available, including courses for schools staff and people working with children, and professional drivers.Charitable Community first aid courses also offer people of all ages the chance to learn basic first aid skills at little or no charge. In 2013, 24,000 people attended these courses.Work with young people.St John Ambulance teaches first aid to thousands of young people, through programmes including Badgers (for five- to ten-year-olds), Cadets (10- to 17-year-olds - see St John Ambulance Cadets in the UK for more information), LINKS (based in colleges and universities) and RISE, a specialist project aimed at those not in education, employment or training.In 2013, 91,000 schoolchildren were trained in first aid by St John Ambulance\'s schools team, while hundreds of thousands more had access to the organisation\'s training materials for schools, which are available to download for free from its Teach the difference website.In 2014, the organisation also launched The Big First Aid Lesson, a free first aid lesson, which was streamed live into classrooms across England. 32,384 students took part in the inaugural event, and another is planned for June 2015.Super Badger Award.St John Ambulance Badgers work towards the \'Super Badger Award\'. This award consists of members completing 12 subjects, such as \'Creative\', \'Global\' and \'Wild\' Badger. The award is split into five sections, where Badgers advance through completing more subjects.Grand Prior Award scheme.The Grand Prior Award is the primary award designed for cadets. The award is an essential part of Cadet life, and consists of completion of 24 subject areas over the period of Cadet membership, until the age of 21.Every year a reception is held at Buckingham Palace and is attended by HRH The Princess Royal to celebrate chosen individuals who have gained their Grand Prior Award.Amalfi Challenge.The Amalfi Award is open to all Cadets and adult volunteers aged 16 to 25. The structure of the award focuses on personal task set by the individual. These tasks are categorised into service, relationships, society and challenge. Each participant has to undertake 12 tasks and at completion of 4, 8 and 12 subjects a badge is awarded.LINKS units.St John Ambulance units dedicated to meeting the needs of student and university communities can be found at many institutes of higher education across England. These units, known as LINKS units, were originally established at universities to form a \'link\' between Cadets and adult volunteering, allowing people to stay affiliated to the organization and maintain their skills while in higher education. However, LINKS units have become integral parts of the student community and the 90% of LINKS member are new to St John Ambulance at the point of joining, as students new to university look for societies to join.Campaigning and awareness-raising.St John Ambulance campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of first aid, and equip more people with life-saving skills. Its 2013 Save the boy campaign, which featured an interactive element, demonstrating how to put a casualty in the recovery position, reached 15 million people through television and online media.In January 2015, it launched a new campaign, The Chokeables, designed to teach parents how to treat a choking infant. The animated film featured the voices of actors John Hurt, David Walliams, Johnny Vegas and David Mitchell.During the annual Save a Life September campaign, St John Ambulance trainers hold free first aid demonstrations in public spaces around the country, handing out first aid guides to attendees. A free first aid app for smartphones is also available to download.Ambulance services.St John Ambulance is leading supplier of ambulance services in England, providing patient transport services to over 100,000 people year, and working in partnership with NHS trusts, private healthcare groups, local authorities and individuals.Services offered include A&E support, patient transport, bariatric transfer, paediatric and neonatal services, high-dependency transfers, planned journeys, repatriations, community first response and emergency response and major incident support.In 2010, St John Ambulance was awarded the Private Ambulance Service Team of the Year Award by the Ambulance Services Institute for the work it carried out with the CATS (Great Ormond Street) and the South Thames Retrieval Service (Eveline Children\'s Hospital)First aid and medical equipment services.St John Ambulance Supplies (often abbreviated to SJS) is a trading sub-division of St John Ambulance providing first aid and medical equipment and consumables, training equipment, publications, health and safety equipment and clothing. Where a profit is made, surplus from sales are diverted into supporting the charitable work of the Order of St John and the St John Ophthalmic Hospital in Jerusalem.SJS opened its doors at St Johns Gate in Clerkenwell on 12 February 1879 and was originally known as The Stores Depot. It is now a major commercial operation supplying to the public, private and voluntary sector.Vehicles.As individual (local) Divisions of St John Ambulance have historically been responsible for providing their own vehicles, these have taken many and varied forms, beginning with horse-drawn ambulances. Even into the late twentieth century, with some centralisation of control and classification of vehicle types such as Motor Ambulance Units (the title arising historically as a distinction from horse-drawn units), First Aid Posts and Rapid Deployment Vehicles, there remained within the organisation an enormous range of deployed vehicles of different types and even assorted local vehicle liveries. Some ambulances were donated second-hand from industrial plants, some were purchased (from different suppliers) and some were local conversions of commercial vehicles. At the start of the twenty-first century, new legislation regarding emergency ambulances effectively rendered a significant proportion of the then current St John Ambulance fleet redundant. The solution was the development of a specialist St John Ambulance vehicle, which was designed jointly by the organisation and vehicle manufacturer Renault. The result was the Crusader 900 ambulance.An early assessment suggested that 100 of the Crusader ambulances (costing, at that time, 40,000 each) would be required immediately, representing an investment of 4 million. In 2000, St John Ambulance committed itself to raising 2 million by public subscription, whilst English and Welsh Freemasons committed a further 2 million, supplying 50 Crusader ambulances which were handed over in local ceremonies across the country during 2000 and 2001. This very large donation allowed the rapid transformation of the national St John Ambulance fleet of front-line ambulances within a much shorter time-scale than could otherwise have been possible. Subsequently, many local Provinces of Freemasons have maintained relations with their local St John Ambulance County units and supported the running costs of these vehicles or even donated further (additional) Crusader ambulances.Specialist Vehicles.St John Ambulance also maintains specialist response options in particular locations, such as the Motorcycle Units, Cycle Response Units, as well as larger vehicles or trailers used as static First Aid posts.Volunteers.The majority of St John Ambulance\'s volunteers deliver first aid at events and as Community First Responders or work with young people as youth leaders. Other specialist roles are available for healthcare professionals, volunteer managers and in safeguarding, human resources, quality and assurance and health and safety.Training and skills.Volunteers receive training according to the role they fulfill. Those volunteering to provide Event First Aid services are offered a number of first aid qualifications, ranging from a basic emergency life support course and the further first aid modules, which deal with common injuries and ailments, through to Emergency Transport Attendant training which covers many of the competencies of the National Health Service Ambulance Technicians. The training for those delivering Youth Services comprises emergency life support training, coupled with training from the organisation\'s own youth leader training suite including Essential skills in youth work and Leadership skills in youth work, depending on the volunteer\'s role.In addition to medical training offered, members have the opportunity to carry out other operational roles. These include event planning, event management, radio communications/control, plus other support roles such as providing member refreshements at events etc.Healthcare Professionals.All healthcare professionals have their qualifications and professional status checked with the appropriate regulatory body before practising in St John Ambulance. Professionals can carry out any skill appropriate to their type, level of training, competence and when relevant to the situation or patient. Healthcare professionals wear coloured rank slides to distinguish them from internally trained first aiders and ambulance personnel.With the exception of Paramedics/IHCD Ambulance Technicians, any HCP wishing to work on an ambulance though must become a PTA/ETA, but parts of the training may be omitted if the candidate can attain accreditation of prior learning. This is dependent on the HCP\'s professional training already undertaken. This is to ensure that the HCP is prepared for working in an ambulance/emergency environment (which they may never have done).Structure.In 2012, St John Ambulance was reorganised into an eight-region structure, with the goal of increasing accountability and maximising charitable outputs.As part of the reorganisation, a more streamlined structure was introduced, with fewer layers of management between the front-line and the St John Ambulance Board.St John Ambulance regions.Each region is managed by a regional director, and is responsible for the delivery of programmes developed and overseen by National Headquarters. All eight regions are accountable to the Care Quality Commission and are independently inspected by the CQC against 14 different outcomes, such as care and welfare of people who use the services, cleanliness and infection control and supporting workers.District.The region is divided into a number of districts, usually between three and five, depending on the number of units in the region. A district may contain one or more former counties from the previous structure. Each district is managed by a district manager, and area managers report to them. District managers are in overall charge of all activities in their district, assisted by the area managers. They have a support team of district specialists in place coordinating functions such as event cover and youth provision, but they have no line management responsibility and report to their respective regional departmental manager. Each district usually contains 36 areas.Area.Districts are further divided into geographic areas, led by an area manager. Unit managers report to the area manager, and the area manager is in overall charge of the activities of the units in their area, within the boundaries of policies etc. set by Regional Headquarters (RHQ) and NHQ. They are assisted/advised by district specialists to provide the day-to-day functions of the organisation, such as member training and event cover. Each area contains about 815 units.Unit.A unit (formerly a division) is the smallest administrative division of St John Ambulance. Most volunteers are managed within a unit and by a unit manager. Units traditionally were ambulance divisions (for men), nursing divisions (for women) and ambulance cadet divisions and nursing cadet divisions for boys and girls respectively. In modern times, only a few single-sex divisions remain and most are either termed \'combined division\' (men and women together) or \'quadrilateral division\' (men and women, boys and girls under one command structure). Other types of local units exist, such as Badger Setts (for 5- to 10-year-olds) and specialised groups such as cycle response units, LINKS units within universities and sometimes informal social groups, each with a distinctive command, management or leadership structure.The unit manager may have one or more assistant unit managers to assist them.The unit usually has a weekly meeting where members train, practice their skills, and occasionally have visits from guest speakers. Youth units (badgers and cadets) follow the St John Ambulance youth programme.Units plan and execute the cover of most of the events requested of the organisation, supported by their area and district managers, district specialists and regional events team. Units are where most people start their time in the organisation.Uniform and ranks.St John Ambulance first aid personnel wear a service delivery uniform consisting of a green shirt, black combat trousers, either a green and black Parka Jacket or a reversible fleece and appropriate black footwear. A ceremonial uniform still exists, consisting of a peaked cap, tailored jacket, white shirt, black trousers, black shoes and clip-on tie. All rank insignia are worn on the outer layer of the jacket; on the service delivery uniform, a role badge is worn to denote the wearer\'s first-aid qualification. High-visibility two-tone yellow-and-green tabards (accepted to denote medical personnel) are only worn when the risk assessment of the event calls for it.St John Ambulance in the British Armed forces.St John Ambulance now has British divisions running where there are a large amount of British servicemen and women with their families overseas. These are namely in Germany and Cyprus. The divisions are directly linked to the UK and national headquarters so that members can transfer to another division or county as they would be able to do at home. The overseas divisions are classed as two \'areas\' in the St John Ambulance structure. The uniform reflects the current service delivery uniform.Volunteers can receive training in the full range of St John Ambulance qualifications.The overseas forces divisions were originally founded in 1980. They remained very strong for several years, however, as the forces in Germany were reduced many divisions closed. Since the final withdrawal of forces in Germany is expected in the next few years, the role for St John Ambulance will end. However the two units in Cyprus founded in 1991 will continue to provide a service to the community there.As well as providing medical cover at events, St John Ambulance British Forces provides first-aid training for people of all ages.St John Ambulance British Forces Overseas works closely with the German Ambulance Services, particularly the sister organisation Die Johanniter in providing first aid and ambulance cover German public events where many British or English Speakers are expected to attend. Members can occasionally be seen on their non-emergency and emergency vehicles responding to public calls. St John Ambulance can also be seen working with Malteser, the German Red Cross and local fire brigades which provide ambulance services. The German Emergency Services also assist St John Ambulance at British events on military areas where many German civilians are expected to attend.Relations with the Order of St John and other organisations.Although the Order of St John is largely seen as a Christian organisation for historical reasons, St John Ambulance does not restrict membership to nor promote any particular religion or denomination. Technically, it falls under the sovereignty of The Queen, and thus is linked to the Church of England; however, this relationship is more tradition than authority, and adult members are not required to pledge allegiance to or support either the monarchy or the Christian faith. Cadet members do still make a pledge upon joining to the monarch and to God.St John Ambulance personnel serve alongside the British Red Cross, whose members also undergo advanced training in first aid and event cover. Both organisations work support the statutory services in times of civil emergency or crisis.St John Ambulance, St. Andrew\'s First Aid in Scotland and the British Red Cross co-author and authorize the official First Aid Manual, the de facto UK guide for emergency first aid.'),(32847001,'Hebrew_and_Aramaic_papyri','Hebrew and Aramaic papyri.Hebrew and Aramaic papyri have increasingly been discovered from the 1960s onwards, although these papyri remain rare compared to papyri written in Koine Greek and Demotic Egyptian (no relation except in name, popular, to modern demotic Greek). The most valuable and religious texts were written on leather scrolls, parchment - such as the literary texts from Masada and Qumran, while papyrus was employed for cheaper, domestic use.A standard work is the Corpus Papyrorum Judaicarum of Victor Tcherikover and Alexander Fuks (Cambridge, Mass. Vol.I 1957, II 1960, III ed. Menahem Stern 1964) which is largely of Greek language papyri but includes examples of Hebrew and Aramaic papyri from Palestine, Jordan, and Egypt.In Egypt.In 1909 Joseph Offord remarks that Germany had acquired all the Hebrew papyri found in Upper Egypt the previous winter, but that many were still to be found. In 1966 the Bodleian Library possessed only four Hebrew and three Aramaic papyri.Qumran.The main corpus, in terms of volume and significance, are the finds at Qumran (1948 onwards). Very few Biblical papyri (as opposed to scrolls) were found at Qumran.Aside from Qumran.In January 1952 Gerald Lankester Harding and Roland de Vaux commenced excavations in four caves at Wadi Murabba\'at. 173 documents were found. 1 Aramaic and 1 Greek papyri only were found at the Wadi Sdeir.In 1960-1961 Yigael Yadin excavated Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic papyri from the Cave of Letters at Nahal Hever (classified by XHev manuscript numbers) among which there were 15 letters; 10 in Hebrew, 3 in Aramaic and 2 in Greek.In 1962 further finds of 18 Aramaic papyri from Samaria were made in the Wadi Daliyeh.The 4 papyri from Nahal Se\'elim (Wadi Seiyal) are in Greek.Inscriptions.The related area of inscriptions are documented in Jean Baptiste Frey, Corpus Inscriptionum Iudaicarum, 2 vols.

The family took part in the Norman conquest of England and the later Norman invasion of Ireland. The name is first recorded for Hugh de Lacy (10201085). His sons, Walter and Ilbert, left Normandy and travelled to England with William the Conqueror. The awards of land by the Conqueror to the de Lacy sons led to two distinct branches of the family: the northern branch, centred on Blackburnshire and west Yorkshire was held by Ilbert\'s descendants; the southern branch of Marcher Lords, centred on Herefordshire and Shropshire, was held by Walter\'s descendants.Until 1399, the northern branch of the family held the great Lordship of Bowland before it passed through marriage to the Duchy of Lancaster. They were also Barons of Pontefract and later Earls of Lincoln.The southern branch of the family became substantial landholders in the Lordship of Ireland and was linked to the Scottish royal family; Elizabeth de Burgh, great granddaughter of Walter de Lacy, married Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland.Lords of Pontefract, Bowland and Clitheroe==.The sons of Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Lassy (c.1020  27 March 1085), Ilbert and Walter jointly held the Norman lands that were held of the Bishop of Bayeux. They participated in the Norman conquest of England. While there is evidence that Ilbert fought at William\'s side at Hastings, there is no record of Walter fighting at Hastings. Ilbert was a major participant in the Harrying of the North (106970) which effectively ended the quasi-independence of the region through large-scale destruction that resulted in the relative pacification of the local population and the replacement of local Anglo-Danish lords with Normans. In return, he received vast grants of land in West Yorkshire, where he built Pontefract Castle.The Honour of Pontefract, which included the manor of Stanbury, was maintained by Ilbert\'s direct male descendants for the next three generations until 1192. It continued in the female line until 1348.Some of the English holdings lost by Roger the Poitevin due to his rebellion were awarded to Robert de Lacy, the son of Ilbert de Lacy. In 1102, King Henry I of England granted the fee of the ancient wapentake of Blackburnshire and further holdings in Hornby, and the vills of Chipping, Aighton and Dutton in Amounderness to de Lacy while confirming his possession of the Lordship of Bowland. These lands formed the basis of what became known as the Honour of Clitheroe.By marriage, John de Lacy gained more titles, including that of the Earldom of Lincoln in 1221.Notable family members.Hugh de Lacy (c.1020, lord of Lassy (Normandy)  27 March 1085, Hereford)Lords of Weobley and Ludlow.Walter de Lacy, the son of Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Lassy, was granted the lordship of Weobley in Herefordshire after the Conquest. He is already attested in the Welsh Marches by 1069. By the time of Walter\'s death, he held blocks of land in Herefordshire (including Holme Lacy) along the border with Wales with another group of lands centered on Ludlow in Shropshire. These groupings allowed Walter to help defend the EnglandWales border against Welsh raids. He also had smaller holdings in Berkshire, Gloucestershire, Worcestershire and Oxfordshire. Walter was second in the region only to William FitzOsbern, 1st Earl of Hereford and his son, Roger de Breteuil although he was not subordinate to them. After the latter\'s rebellion against the king in 1075 [which Walter de Lacy helped to ensure failed] Walter became the leading baron in the region.Lordship of Meath.In addition to his substantial land holdings in Herefordshire and Shropshire, England as 4th Baron de Lacy, Hugh de Lacy was also a substantial land holder in Ireland. Following his participation in the Norman Invasion of Ireland, he was granted the lands of a Gaelic medieval kingdom by the Anglo-Norman King Henry II of England in 1172 by the service of fifty knights. The Lordship of Meath was an extensive seigniorial liberty in medieval Ireland with almost royal authority. The Lordship was roughly co-extensive with the Kingdom of Meath. At its greatest extent, it included all of the modern counties of Fingal, Meath (which takes its name from the kingdom), Westmeath as well as parts of counties Cavan, Kildare, Longford, Louth and Offaly. The Lordship\'s caput was Trim Castle. With an area of 30,000 m, it is the largest castle in Ireland. The design of the central three-story keep (also known as a donjon or great tower) is unique for a Norman keep being of cruciform shape, with twenty corners.These lords were reliant on their own aggression for laying claim to their lands and for securing them. Castles, by virtue of their defensive and offensive capabilities as well as their symbolic status, were indispensable for dominating the area of the lordship. Known as a great builder of castles, by c. 1200, de Lacy had settlements all over the lordship, either in his own hands or the hands of his barons. With his son Walter (1180  1240) he built Trim Castle and Kilkea Castle. Some time after 1196, Walter granted the whole land of Rathtowth to his younger brother, Hugh. This sub-division, named the Barony of Ratoath, was perhaps the first instance of the use of the term barony in Ireland for a division of a county. By letters patent from John, King of England, the prescriptive barony was granted to Walter de Lacy and his heirs in perpetuity in 1208.Notable family members.Hugh de Lacy, Lord of Meath (before 1135  25 July 1186) was the great-grandson of Walter de Lacy of the Norman Conquest.Other notable members of the family.Note: the Lacy baronets of Ampton Hall is an unrelated family.'),(1244341,'Rebecca_Jenkins','Rebecca Jenkins.Rebecca Jenkins (born 1959 or 1960) is a Canadian actress and singer.Acting.She had starring roles in the 1990s CBC series Black Harbour, and the films Bye Bye Blues, Marion Bridge, Wilby Wonderful, Whole New Thing, South of Wawa and Supervolcano.

Catholics trace the origins of the office of bishop to the apostles, who it is believed were endowed with a special charism by the Holy Spirit at Pentecost. Catholics believe this special charism has been transmitted through an unbroken succession of bishops by the laying on of hands in the sacrament of Holy Orders.Diocesan bishopsknown as eparchs in the Eastern Catholic Churchesare assigned to govern local regions within the Catholic Church known as dioceses in the Latin Church and eparchies in the Eastern Rites. Bishops are collectively known as the College of Bishops and can hold such additional titles as archbishop, cardinal, patriarch, or pope. As of 2009 there were approximately 5,100 bishops total in the Latin and Eastern churches of the Catholic Church.Diocesan bishops or eparchs.The traditional role of a bishop is to act as head of a diocese or eparchy. Dioceses vary considerably in geographical size and population. A wide variety of dioceses around the Mediterranean Sea which received the Christian faith early are rather compact in size, while those in areas more recently evangelized, as in some parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, South America and the Far East, tend to be much larger and more populous. Within his own diocese a Latin Church bishop may use pontifical vestments and regalia, but may not do so in another diocese without, at least, the presumed consent of the appropriate ordinary.Resignation at 75.Article 401.1 of the Latin-Rite Code of Canon Law states that A diocesan Bishop who has completed his seventy-fifth year of age is requested to offer his resignation from office to the Supreme Pontiff, who, taking all the circumstances into account, will make provision accordingly.Roles.A diocesan bishop is entrusted with the care of a local Church (diocese). He is responsible for teaching, governing, and sanctifying the faithful of his diocese, sharing these duties with the priests and deacons who serve under him.To teach, sanctify and govern means that he must (1) oversee preaching of the Gospel and Catholic education in all its forms; (2) oversee and provide for the administration of the sacraments; and (3) legislate, administer and act as judge for canon-law matters within his diocese. He serves as the chief shepherd (spiritual leader) of the diocese and has responsibility for the pastoral care of all Catholics living within his ecclesiastical and ritual jurisdiction. He is obliged to celebrate Mass every Sunday and Holy Day of Obligation with the intention of praying for those in his care, assign clergy to their posts in various institutions and oversee finances. A bishop is to have a special concern for priests, listening to them, using them as counsellors, ensuring that they are adequately provided for in every way, and defending their rights set forth in the Code of Canon Law. Latin Catholic bishops also must make regular ad limina visits to the Holy See every five years.Because of their function as teachers of the faith, it is customary in some English-speaking countries, to add to the names of bishops the postnominal title of D.D. (Doctor of Divinity) and to refer to them with the title Doctor.Only a bishop has authority to confer the sacrament of holy orders. In the Latin Church the minor orders were abolished after the Second Vatican Council. In Eastern Catholic rites, a monastic archimandrite may tonsure and institute his subjects to minor orders; however, the tonsure and minor orders are not considered to be part of the sacrament of holy orders.The sacrament of Confirmation is normally administered by a bishop in the Latin Church, but a bishop may delegate the administration to a priest. In the case of receiving an adult into full communion with the Catholic Church the presiding priest will administer Confirmation. In the Eastern Catholic Churches, Confirmation (called Chrismation) is normally administered by priests as it is given at the same time as baptism. It is only within the power of the diocesan bishop or eparch to bless churches and altars, although he may delegate another bishop, or even a priest, to perform the ceremony.On Holy Thursday Latin Catholic bishops preside over the Mass of the Chrism. Though Oil of the Sick for the sacrament of Anointing of the Sick is blessed at this Mass, it may also be blessed by any priest in case of necessity. Only a bishop may consecrate Chrism. In the Eastern Catholic Churches chrism is consecrated solely by heads of churches sui juris (patriarchs and metropolitans) and diocesan bishops may not do so.Only a bishop or other ordinary may grant imprimaturs for theological books, certifying that they are free from doctrinal or moral error; this is an expression of the teaching authority, and education responsibility of the bishop.Prior to the Second Vatican Council, it was also the prerogative of the bishop to consecrate the paten and chalice that would be used during the Mass. One of the changes implemented since the Council, is that a simple blessing is now said and it may be given by any priest.Canonical authority.In both Western and Eastern Catholic churches, any priest can celebrate the Mass. In order to offer Mass publicly, however, a priest is required to have permission from the local Ordinaryauthority for this permission may be given to pastors of parishes for a limited period, but for long-term permission recourse to the diocesan bishop is usually required. A celebret may be issued to travelling priests so that they can demonstrate to pastors and bishops outside of their own diocese that they are in good standing. However, even if a priest does not possess such a document, he may celebrate the sacraments if the local bishop or pastor judges that the visiting priest is a person of good character.In the East an antimension signed by the bishop is kept on the altar partly as a reminder of whose altar it is and under whose omophorion the priest at a local parish is serving.For priests to validly celebrate the sacrament of Penance they must have faculties (permission and authority) from the local bishop; however when the penitent is in danger of death, a priest has both the right and obligation to hear the confession no matter where he may be.To preside at matrimony ceremonies, Latin Church priests and deacons must have appropriate jurisdiction or delegation from a competent authority. In the Latin branch of the Catholic Church, the teaching is that it is the couple themselves who administer the graces of the sacrament; thus, although it is normally an ordained person who officiates at a marriage ceremony, a bishop may delegate a lay person to be present for the exchange of vows; this would be done only in extreme cases such as in mission territories. In the Eastern tradition, the clergy not only witness the exchange of vows but must impart a blessing for a valid marriage to have taken place.Unless a particular bishop has forbidden it, any bishop may preach throughout the Catholic Church and any priest or deacon may also preach anywhere (presuming the permission of local pastor) unless his faculty to preach has been restricted or removed.The cathedral of a diocese contains a special chair, called a cathedra, sometimes referred to as a throne, set aside in the sanctuary for the exclusive use of its Ordinary; it symbolises his spiritual and ecclesiastical authority.Bishop-elect.A bishop who has been canonically selected for a see, but hasn\'t yet taken possession of it.Titular bishop.A titular bishop (or titular archbishop) is a bishop assigned to a titular see, which is usually the name of a city or area that used to be the seat of a diocese, but whose episcopal see (diocese) is no longer functioning as such. Titular bishops often serve as auxiliary bishops, as officials in the Roman Curia, in the Patriarchal Curias of Eastern Churches, as papal diplomatic envoys (notably apostolic nuncios or apostolic delegates), or head certain missionary pre-diocesan jurisdictions (notably as apostolic vicar). Since 1970, a coadjutor bishop uses the title of the see he is assigned to, and a bishop emeritus uses the title of his last residential see.Suffragan bishop.A suffragan bishop leads a diocese within an ecclesiastical province other than the principal diocese, the metropolitan archdiocese.Auxiliary bishop.An auxiliary bishop is a full-time assistant to a diocesan bishop. Auxiliaries are titular bishops without the right of succession, who assist the diocesan bishop in a variety of ways and are usually appointed as vicars general or episcopal vicars of the diocese in which they serve.Coadjutor bishop.A coadjutor bishop is a bishop who is given almost equal authority to that of the diocesan bishop; he has special faculties and the right to succeed the incumbent diocesan bishop. The appointment of coadjutors is seen as a means of providing for continuity of church leadership. Until recent times, there was the possibility of a coadjutor bishop not having the right of succession.Bishop-prelate.A bishop who is consecrated as such, but holds an office that as such doesn\'t require episcopal rank (so the incumbent won\'t be made a titular bishop), just that of Prelate, notably as Territorial prelate. Emeritus bishop.When a diocesan bishop or auxiliary bishop retires, he is given the honorary title of emeritus of his last see, i.e., archbishop emeritus, bishop emeritus, or auxiliary bishop emeritus of the see. For the (arch)bishop of a diocese, emeritus is inserted into the title for the last diocese that the (arch)bishop occupied. An example in usage would be: Most Reverend John Jones, Bishop Emeritus of the Diocese of Anytown. For a cardinal, who does not cease to be a cardinal and a bishop, though no longer bishop of a see, it would be: Cardinal James Smith, Archbishop Emeritus of the Archdiocese of Anycity.On his resignation as Pope (Bishop of Rome), Benedict XVI became His Holiness Benedict XVI, Supreme Pontiff Emeritus or Pope Emeritus.Cardinal.A cardinal is a member of the clergy appointed by the Pope to serve in the College of Cardinals. Members of the College aged under 80 elect a new pope, who is in practice always one of their number, on the death or resignation of the incumbent. Cardinals also serve as papal advisors and hold positions of authority within the structure of the Catholic Church. Under canon law, a man appointed a cardinal must normally be a bishop, or accept consecration as a bishop, but may seek papal permission to decline. Most cardinals are already bishops when appointed, the majority being archbishops of important archdioceses or patriarchates, others already serving as titular bishops in the Roman Curia. Recent popes have appointed a few priests, most of them renowned theologians, to the College of Cardinals, and these have been permitted to decline episcopal consecration.Pope.The pope is the man who possesses the sacrament of Holy Orders as a bishop and who has been chosen to be Bishop of Rome. The Catholic Church holds that the College of Bishops as a group is the successor of the College of Apostles. The Church also holds that uniquely among the apostles Saint Peter was granted a role of leadership and authority, giving the Pope the right to govern the Church together with the bishops, and making his leadership necessary for the completion of the College. Hence, Catholicism holds that the Bishop of Rome, as successor of Peter, possesses this role: the Pope, uniquely among bishops, may speak for the whole Church, and a council of bishops is incomplete without the approval of the pope. Papal pronouncements which meet the requirements of the decree on papal infallibility of the First Vatican Council, and no others, even in matters of faith and morals, are deemed to be infallible. Papal infallibility has been invoked only twice since the doctrine was instituted and both are about Mary: her Immaculate Conception (declared by Pope Pius IX in 1854 and grandfathered in after the First Vatican Councils declaration of papal infallibility in 1870) and her bodily Assumption into heaven (declared by Pope Pius XII in 1950).Patriarch and Catholicos.Catholicos is an Eastern title roughly similar to that of patriarch. In the Catholic Church it is applied to a prelate who is also a major archbishop.Major archbishop.Major archbishops are the heads of some of the Eastern Catholic Churches. The major archbishops\' authority within their respective sui juris churches is equal to that of a patriarch, but they receive fewer ceremonial honours.Primate.In the Catholic, Anglican, and some other Churches a primate is usually the bishop of the oldest diocese and/or the capital of a (present or former) nation; the title is one of honour.Metropolitan archbishop.A metropolitan bishop is an archbishop with minor jurisdiction over an ecclesiastical province; in practice this amounts to presiding at meetings and overseeing a diocese which has no bishop.In Eastern Catholicism a metropolitan may also be the head of an autocephalous, sui juris, or autonomous church when the number of adherents of that tradition is small. In the Latin Church, metropolitans are always archbishops; in many Eastern churches, the title is Metropolitan, with some of these churches using archbishop as a separate office.Public office.Since the publication of the new Code of Canon Law in 1983 by Pope John Paul II, all members of the Catholic clergy are forbidden to hold public office without the express permission of the Holy See.Consecration of bishops and eparchs.The appointment of bishops in the Catholic Church is a complicated process that requires the participation of several officials. In the Latin Church, the local synod, the papal nuncio (or apostolic delegate), various dicasteries of the Roman Curia, and the Pope all take a part; since the 1970s it has become common practice for the nuncio to solicit input from clergy and laity within the vacant diocese. In patriarchal and major archiepiscopal Eastern Churches, the permanent synod, the holy synod, and the patriarch or major archbishop also play a role in the selection of bishops.Apostolic succession and other churches.The Catholic Church has always taught that bishops are descended from a continuous line of bishops since the days of the apostles, which is known as apostolic succession. Since 1896, when Pope Leo XIII issued the bull Apostolicae curae, the Catholic Church has not recognised Anglican orders as valid, because of changes in the ordination rites that took place in the 16th century as well as divergence in the understanding of the theology of episcopacy and Eucharist. However, this view has since been complicated because Old Catholic bishops, whose orders are fully recognised as valid by Rome, have acted as co-consecrators in Anglican episcopal consecrations. According to the church historian Timothy Dufort, by 1969 all Church of England bishops had acquired Old Catholic lines of apostolic succession fully recognised by the Holy See.However, the Holy See does not recognise as valid the orders of any group whose teaching is at variance with core tenets of Christianity even though it may use the proper ritual. The recent practice of Independent Catholic groups to ordain women has added a definite cloudiness to the recognition of the validity of orders, as the act of ordaining women as priests or bishops is incompatible with Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy. The practice by some independent clergy of receiving multiple ordinations also demonstrates an understanding of Holy Orders which is at variance with Catholicism and Orthodoxy, both of which hold that a person is either ordained or not.Latin Church.The everyday dress of Latin Church bishops may consist of a black (or, in tropical countries, white) cassock with amaranth trim and purple fascia, along with a pectoral cross and episcopal ring. The 1969 Instruction on the dress of prelates stated that the dress for ordinary use may instead be a simple cassock without coloured trim. Since 1969, a black suit and clerical shirt, already customary in English-speaking countries, has become very common also in countries where previously it was unknown.A Latin Church bishop\'s choir dress, which is worn when attending but not celebrating liturgical functions, consists of the purple cassock with amaranth trim, rochet, purple zuchetto, purple biretta with a tuft, and pectoral cross. The cappa magna may be worn, but only within the bishop\'s own diocese and on especially solemn occasions.The mitre, zuchetto, and stole are generally worn by bishops when presiding over liturgical functions. For liturgical functions other than the Mass the bishop typically wears the cope. Within his own diocese and when celebrating solemnly elsewhere with the consent of the local ordinary, he also uses the crosier. When celebrating Mass, a bishop, like a priest, wears the chasuble. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum recommends, but does not impose, that in solemn celebrations a bishop should also wear a dalmatic, which can always be white, beneath the chasuble, especially when administering the sacrament of holy orders, blessing an abbot or abbess, and dedicating a church or an altar. The Caeremoniale Episcoporum no longer makes mention of pontifical gloves, pontifical sandals, liturgical stockings (also known as buskins), the maniple, or the accoutrements that it once prescribed for the bishop\'s horse.Eastern Catholic.The everyday dress of Eastern Catholic bishops is often the same as their Latin Church counterparts: black clerical suite with pectoral cross or panagia. When attending liturgical functions at which he does not celebrate, an Eastern Catholic bishop usually wears a mantya, panagia and an engolpion if he is a patriarch or metropolitan bishop. He will also carry a pastoral staff in the form of a walking stick topped by a pommel. Eastern Catholic bishops do not normally use an episcopal ring.When participating in the Divine Liturgy, an Eastern Catholic bishop will wear the sakkos (Imperial dalmatic), omophorion, epigonation and Eastern-style mitre. The most typical mitre in the Eastern Catholic churches is based on the closed Imperial crown of the late Byzantine Empire. It is made in the shape of a bulbous crown, completely enclosed, and the material is of brocade, damask or cloth of gold. It may be embroidered, and richly decorated with jewels. There are normally four icons attached to the mitre: (Christ, the Theotokos, John the Baptist and the Cross. Eastern mitres are usually gold, but other liturgical colours may be used. The mitre is often topped by a cross, either made out of metal and standing upright, or embroidered in cloth and lying flat on the top. He will also carry a crosier of the Eastern style.'),(43028000,'Hoist_The_King','Hoist The King.Hoist The King (1978  1995) was an American Thoroughbred racehorse who sold for a record-setting $1.6 million ($ million inflation adjusted) as a yearling in 1979.

Unlike most other Bulgarians, they are Roman Catholic by confession and stem from groups of Paulicians and Roman Catholics from modern northern and northwestern Bulgaria.Banat Bulgarians speak a distinctive codified form of the Eastern Bulgarian vernacular with much lexical influence from the other languages of the Banat. Although strongly acculturated to the Central European region, they have preserved their Bulgarian identity.Since the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, many have returned to Bulgaria and founded separate villages there.Population.The official Romanian census states that 6,468 people of Bulgarian origin inhabit the Romanian part of the Banat. The Serbian census of 2002 recognized 1,658 Bulgarians in Vojvodina, the autonomous province that covers the Serbian part of the Banat. Bulgarian researchers estimate that 12,000 Banat Bulgarians live in Romania and 3,000 in Serbia.The earliest and most important centres of the Banat Bulgarian population are the villages of Dudetii Vechi (Str Binov) and Vinga, both today in Romania,but notable communities also exist in Romania in Bretea (Bra), Colonia Bulgar (Telepa) and Denta (Dnta), and the cities of Timioara (Timivr) and Snnicolau Mare (Smiklu), as well as in Serbia in the villages of Ivanovo, Konak (Kanak), Jaa Tomi (Modo), and Skorenovac (Gjurgevo).In Bulgaria, returning Banat Bulgarians populated the villages of Asenovo, Bardarski Geran, Dragomirovo, Gostilya, and Bregare, among others, in some of which they coexist or coexisted with Banat Swabians, other Bulgarian Roman Catholics, and Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians.Historical population.According to various censuses and estimates, not always accurate, the number of the Banat Bulgarians varied asOrigin and migration north of the Danube.The Bulgarian Roman Catholic community in the north-western ore-mining town of Chiprovtsi and surrounding villages was possibly established in the Middle Ages by Saxon miners, who later migrated elsewhere or were assimilated. In 1688, the members of the community organized the unsuccessful Chiprovtsi Uprising against the Ottoman rule of Bulgaria. The uprising was suppressed due to organizational flaws and the halting of the Austrian offensive against the Ottomans. Around 300 families of the surviving Catholics fled north of the Danube to Oltenia, initially settling in Craiova, Rmnicu Vlcea, and other cities, where their existing rights were confirmed by Wallachian Prince Constantin Brncoveanu. Some moved to south-western Transylvania, founding colonies in Vinu de Jos (1700) and Deva (1714) and receiving privileges such as civil rights and tax exemption.After Oltenia was occupied by Austria in 1718, the status of the Bulgarians in the region improved again, as an imperial decree of 1727 allowed them the same privileges as their colonies in Transylvania. This attracted another wave of migration of Bulgarian Catholics, about 300 families from the formerly Paulician villages of central northern Bulgaria. They settled in Craiova between 1726 and 1730, but did not receive the same rights as the colonists from Chiprovtsi.The Habsburgs were forced to withdraw from Oltenia in 1737 in the wake of a new war with the Ottoman Empire. The Bulgarians fled from this new Ottoman occupation and settled in the Austrian-ruled Banat to the northwest. The Austrian authorities allowed them to found the villages of Str Binov in 1738 and Vinga (or Theresiopolis) in 1741. In 1744, a decree of Maria Theresa of Austria again confirmed their privileges received in Oltenia.Austrian and Hungarian rule.Around a hundred Paulicians from the region of Svishtov and Nikopol migrated to the Banat from 1753 to 1777.The existing Bulgarian population quickly spread throughout the region from the late 18th to the second quarter of the 19th century. They settled in around 20 villages and towns in search of better economic conditions, specifically their need for arable land. Such colonies include those in Modo (1779), Kanak and Stari Lec (1820), Belo Blato (1885), Bra, Dnta, and Banatski Dvor (1842), Telepa (1846), Gjurgevo (1866), and Ivanovo (1867).After they settled, the Banat Bulgarians began to take care of their education and religion. The Neo-Baroque church in Str Binov was built in 1804 and the imposing Neo-Gothic church in Vinga in 1892. Until 1863, Banat Bulgarians held liturgies in Latin and Illyric. Illyric was a strain of Croatian which had spread in the communities before they migrated to the Banat. However, with their cultural revival in the mid-19th century, their vernacular was gradually introduced in the church. The revival also led to the release of their first printed book, Manachija kathehismus za katolicsanske Paulichiane, in 1851. Illyric was also substituted with Banat Bulgarian in education in 1860 (officially in 1864). In 1866, Jozu Rill codified the dialect with his essay Blgarskotu pravopisanj.After the Ausgleich of 1867, the Hungarian authorities gradually intensified the Magyarization of the Banat. Until World War I, they imposed Hungarian as the main language of education.Interwar Romanian and Serbian Banat.After World War I, Austria-Hungary was dissolved and Banat was divided between Romania and Serbia. Most Banat Bulgarians became citizens of the Kingdom of Romania, but many fell inside the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.In Greater Romania, the Banat Bulgarians\' identity was distinguished in censuses and statistics. The main language of education was changed to Romanian and the Bulgarian schools were nationalized. A Romanian geography book of 1931 describes the Bulgarians in the county of Timi-Torontal as foreigners, and their national dress as not as beautiful as the Romanian one, but in general the Banat Bulgarians were more favourably treated than the larger Eastern Orthodox Bulgarian minority in interwar Romania.The Kingdom of Yugoslavia denied the existence of any Bulgarian minority, whether in the Vardar Banovina, the Western Outlands, or the Banat. Official post-World War I statistics provide no data about the number of the Banat Bulgarians. In comparison with the Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians in Yugoslavia, the Banat Bulgarians were treated better by the Yugoslav authorities, although Serbo-Croatian was the only language of education.In the 1930s, the Banat Bulgarians in Romania entered a period of cultural revival led by figures such as Ivan Fermendin, Anton Lebanov, and Karol Telbis (Telbizov). These new cultural leaders emphasized the Bulgarian identity at the expense of the identification as Paulicians and Roman Catholics, establishing contacts with the Bulgarian government and other Bulgarian communities in Romania, particularly that in Dobruja. The organs of this revival were the newspaper Banatsi balgarsi glasni (Banat Bulgarian Voice), issued between 1935 and 1943, and the annual Banatsi balgarsi kalendar (Banat Bulgarian Calendar), issued from 1936 to 1940. There was a plan to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the settlement in the Banat which was the most significant manifestation by Banat Bulgarians in that period. It was partially spoiled by the Romanian authorities, but still attracted much attention among intellectuals in Bulgaria. The Bulgarian Agrarian Party, a section of the National Peasants\' Party, was founded in 1936 on the initiative of Karol Telbizov and Dr. Karol Manjov of Str Binov, with Petar Telbisz as its chairman, and the Bulgarian National Society in the Banat, also headed by Telbisz, was established in 1939.Bulgaria and Yugoslavia improved their relations in the 1930s, leading to indirect recognition of the Banat Bulgarian minority by the Yugoslav government. Still, the Banat Bulgarian revival was much less perceivable in the Serbian Banat. The Banat Bulgarian population in Yugoslavia was only partially affected by the work of Telbizov, Lebanov, and the other cultural workers in the Romanian Banat.Emigration to Hungary, the United States and Bulgaria.Some Banat Bulgarians migrated again, mainly to Hungary and the United States. According to Bulgarian data from 1942, 10,000 Banat Bulgarians lived in Hungary, mainly in the major cities, but this number is most likely overestimated. Members of the Banat Bulgarian community in Hungary include several deputies to the National Assembly, such as Petar Dobroslav, whose son Lszl Dobroslav (Lszl Bolgr) was a diplomat, and Georgi Velov.During the Interwar period, the Banat Bulgarian communities in Romania were among those experiencing the greatest emigration to the USA, particularly in the 1920s and 1930s. An organized Bulgarian community was established in Lone Wolf, Oklahoma, where the Banat Bulgarians were mostly farmers.A significant number of Banat Bulgarians returned to Bulgaria, beginning in the 1880s and 1890s. They founded several villages in Pleven Province, Vratsa Province and Veliko Tarnovo Province and received privileges, as per the law of 1880, for the settlement of unpopulated lands. They introduced superior agricultural technologies to the country and fully applied their farming experience. Their religious life was partly determined by the clashes between the dominant Eastern Orthodoxy and the minority Catholicism, and cultural conflicts with other Roman Catholic communities which they lived with in several villages, such as the Banat Swabians and the Bulgarian Paulicians from Ilfov.World War II and later.On the eve of World War II, the authoritarian regime of Carol II of Romania and the fascist government under Ion Antonescu widely discriminated against the Bulgarian minority in the Romanian Banat. Bulgarians were often deprived of property and land, subjected to anti-Bulgarian propaganda, and their villages had to shelter Romanian and Aromanian refugees from Northern Transylvania and Southern Dobruja.In May 1941, the Bulgarians in the Romanian Banat contributed to the release of ethnic Bulgarian prisoners of war from the Yugoslav Army, captured by the Axis, from a camp near Timioara. Communicating with the Bulgarian state, Banat Bulgarian leaders headed by Anton Lebanov negotiated the prisoners\' release and transportation to Bulgaria, after the example of the release of captured Hungarian soldiers from the Yugoslav Army. They temporarily accommodated these Bulgarians from Vardar Macedonia and the Serbian Banat and provided them with food until they could be taken to Bulgaria.The Serbian Banat was conquered by Nazi Germany on 12 April 1941, and was occupied for much of the war. In late 1942, the German authorities allowed Bulgarian minority classes to be created in the Serbian schools in Ivanovo, Skorenovac, Konak, Belo Blato, and Jaa Tomi. However, the sudden change in the war and German withdrawal from the Banat forced education in Bulgarian to be discontinued after the 194344 school year.After the war, Banat Bulgarians in Romania and Yugoslavia were ruled by communist regimes. In the Romanian Banat, some were deported in the Brgan deportations in 1951, but most of those were allowed to return in 195657. A Bulgarian school was founded in Dudetii Vechi in 1948, and in Vinga in 1949. Others followed in Bretea, Colonia Bulgar, and Denta, but these were briefly closed or united with the Romanian schools after 1952, and Bulgarian remained an optional subject.The Constitution of Romania of 1991 allowed Bulgarians in the Romanian Banat parliamentary representation through the minority party of the Bulgarian Union of the Banat Romania (Balgarskotu drustvu ud Bant Rumanija), led formerly by Karol-Matej Ivnov and as of 2008 by Nikola Mirkovi, and Bulgarian remained an optional subject in the schools.In post-war Yugoslavia, the existence of a Banat Bulgarian minority was formally recognized, but they were not given the same rights as the larger Bulgarian minority in eastern Serbia. Unlike other minorities in Vojvodina, they were not allowed education in their mother tongue, only Serbo-Croatian.Language.The vernacular of the Bulgarians of Banat can be classified as a Paulician dialect of the Eastern Bulgarian group. A typical feature is the  (*y) vowel, which can either take an etymological place or replace i. Other characteristic phonological features are the  (wide e) reflex of the Old Church Slavonic yat and the reduction of o into u and sometimes e into i: pulj instead of pole (field), slu instead of selo (village), ugniti instead of ognite (fireplace). Another characteristic feature is the palatalization of final consonants, which is typical for other Slavic languages, but found only in non-standard dialects in Bulgarian (Bulgarian den (day) sounds like and is written as denj).Lexically, the language has borrowed many words from languages such as German (such as drot from Draht, wire; gng from Gang, anteroom, corridor), Hungarian (vilnj from villany, electricity; mozi, cinema), Serbo-Croatian (stvr from stvar, item, matter; run from raun, account), and Romanian (edinca from edin, conference) due to the close contacts with the other peoples of the multiethnical Banat and the religious ties with other Roman Catholic peoples. Banat Bulgarian also has some older loanwords from Ottoman Turkish and Greek, which it shares with other Bulgarian dialects (e.g. hirgjn from Turkish ergen, unmarried man, bachelor; trandfer from Greek   triantafyllo, rose). Loanwords constitute around 20% of the Banat Bulgarian vocabulary. The names of some Banat Bulgarians are also influenced by Hungarian names, as the Hungarian (eastern) name order is sometimes used (family name followed by given name) and the female ending -a is often dropped from family names. Thus, Marija Velova would become Velov Marija.Besides loanwords, the lexis of Banat Bulgarian has also acquired calques and neologisms, such as svetica (icon, formerly used ikona and influenced by German Heiligenbild), zarno (bullet, from the word meaning grain), oganbalv (volcano, literally fire belcher), and predhurta (foreword).The Banat Bulgarian language uses its own script, largely based on the Croatian version of the Latin alphabet (Gaj\'s Latin Alphabet), and preserves many features that are archaic in the language spoken in Bulgaria. The language was codified as early as 1866 and is used in literature and press, which distinguishes it from plain dialects.Culture.Banat Bulgarians have engaged in literary activity since they settled in the Banat. Their earliest preserved literary work is the historical record Historia Domus (Historia Parochiae Oppidi -Besseny, in Diocesi Czanadiensi, Comitatu Torontalensi), written in Latin in the 1740s. The codification of the Banat Bulgarian vernacular in 1866 enabled the release of a number of school books and the translation of several important religious works in the mid-19th century. There was a literary revival in the 1930s, centred around the Banatsi balgarsi glasni newspaper. Today, the Bulgarian Union of the Banat Romania issues the biweekly newspaper Na gls and the monthly magazine Literaturna miselj.The music of the Banat Bulgarians is classed as a separate branch of Bulgarian folk music, with several verbal and musical peculiarities. While the typically Bulgarian bars have been preserved, a number of melodies display Romanian, Serbian, and Hungarian influences, and the specific Bulgarian Christmas carols have been superseded by urban-type songs. Roman Catholicism has exerted considerable influence, eliminating certain types of songs and replacing them with others. Similarly, Banat Bulgarians have preserved many Bulgarian holidays but also adopted others from other Roman Catholic peoples. One of the most popular holidays is Farngji, or the Carnival. In terms of dances, Banat Bulgarians have also heavily borrowed from the neighbouring peoples, for example Hungarian csrds.The women\'s national costume of the Banat Bulgarians has two varieties. The costume of Vinga is reminiscent of those of sub-Balkan cities in Bulgaria; the one of Str Binov is characteristic of northwestern Bulgaria. The Vinga costume has been particularly influenced by the dress of Hungarians and Germans, but the Str Binov costume has remained more conservative. The Banat Bulgarian women\'s costume is perceived as particularly impressive with its crown-like headdress.'),(32369879,'Towle%2C_California','Towle, California.Towle (formerly, Towles) is an unincorporated community in Placer County, California.

It is the southernmost town of the province. It is bounded on the north by Sipalay City and Candoni; on the south by Basay, Negros Oriental; on the east by the town of Ilog; and on the west by the Sulu Sea. According to the 2010 census, it has a population of 54,624 people.The total land area of Hinoba-an is 421.50 square kilometers.History.Formerly a part of Cauayan, Hinoba-an was inhabited by natives called Magabat. When immigrants from Panay came and settled in the coastal areas, the settlers began to group in the area where the town is now located. Traders visited to barter products like clothing made in Miag-ao, Tigbauan and Guimbal in Iloilo.Spanish authorities did not occupy Hinoba-an during their time in the province since the area was still a jungle. It was visited only by people from Cauayan and the neighboring towns for hunting purposes, hence no important events were recorded about the coming of the Spaniards in the town until the early 20th century.In the early 1900s, Don Estanislao Bilbao, a Basque migr and patriarch of the Bilbao clan---one of the area\'s prominent families, begun a decades-long process of settling an area south of where Hinoba-an would come to be. In a few years, a significant plot of land had been rehabilitated to which thousands of germinating coconut husks were planted in precise rows. Maturing and bearing crop in under a decade, once coastal wilderness was transformed into copra producing land. Rice fields were likewise developed further inland close to irrigation sources.The subsequent grant of landownership, along with the total absence of government due to area\'s remoteness, became the basis for Don Estanislao\'s provisional administration of the people and the place. He became the area\'s primary, if not for a time, sole employer. As a matter of moral imperative and practical necessity, he also became the de facto Judge and Sheriff, adjudicating upon and enforcing common law.Through his marriage to Felicidad Rivasa patrician heiress to a similarly homesteaded parcel of land nearby, Don Estanislao doubled the size of the holding. Hand-in-hand with Dona Felicidad, they lorded over a highly productive agricultural expanse that, from points north to south, ostensibly stretched for miles on end. The couple\'s lifelong beneficence and philanthropy endeared them to the local populace making the Bilbao name well-respected and well-loved. Generations of offspring have since reaped the fruits of their enduring legacy. A few have gone on to build legacies of their own. Sons Joaquin and Francisco, and daughter-in-law Teresa, have each been elected town\'s mayor. Today, with Mayor Teresa Locsin-Bilbao\'s incumbency, the Bilbao\'s have governed the municipality for a collective span of over thirty years.When the Americans landed in Negros during World War II, Hinoba-an became a historical point of entry by the combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth military forces. Col. Salvador Abcede, district commander of the 7th military district, established his island headquarters in this town during the Japanese occupation.Col. Jesus Villamor, aboard submarine USS Gudgeon (SS211), landed at Ubong Point and occupied Ubong Cave as command post supply food and arms to guerillas.After Liberation, Hinoba-an was rehabilitated by some of its pioneering residents.

The record company was sold to Warner Music Group in the early 1990s.Early days.Claude Carrere started working with Annie Chancel in 1962 and renamed her Sheila, who remained his sole artist for a while. He set up Carrere Productions and the records were distributed by Philips Records. In the late 1960s, he created Disques Carrere. In 1972, he produced and distributed his own releases. A lot of singers would be signed alongside Sheila, the most important ones being Ringo (Sheila\'s husband), Dalida and even Claude Franois. In 1977, the disco group Sheila and B. Devotion was created and Carrere started exporting his releases.British record market.Claude Carrere decided to move into the British record market after the success of La Belle poque single Black Is Black, released in the United Kingdom through EMI, which reached number 2 in the UK Singles Chart. He appointed Freddie Cannon Managing Director (at that time, he was Commercial A&R Director at EMI Records UK) to head up his Carrere UK label. Cannon opened the Carrere offices at Hansa Records UK in June 1978 and signed a South African group named Clout. Carrere\' UK\'s first release was Clout\'s single Substitute, which went to number 2 in the UK Singles Chart in 1978. Cannon and A&R Manager Peter Hinton signed power pop band the Incredible Kidda Band and followed this in 1979 with the NWOBHM band Saxon. Cannon renamed the group Saxon, since he could not work with their original name Son of a Bitch. Saxon released their eponymous debut album the following year and stayed with the label until 1984. In 1981, Cannon signed Australian rock bands The Church and Rose Tattoo, and Don Dokken from the US. The label released also the final album by The Buggles, 1981\'s Adventures in Modern Recording, which was distributed in the United States through Columbia Records. Debbie Bonham also signed to Carrere and released her critically acclaimed album For You and the Moon in 1984. Cannon, working with Carrere Italy\'s Managing Director Luigi Arduino and Claude Carrere, signed Italian singer Raf and secured the rights for the worldwide distribution of his hit single Self Control in 1984. In the same year, Peter Hinton left the company.In 1985, Carrere released Move Closer, the only ballad from the label\'s Disco Queen Phyllis Nelson, and this number 1 song became the label\'s biggest selling single of all time in the UK. It is featured in over 300 compilations around the world. The same year, Carrere released on the sub-label Stars Only Gloria Gaynor\'s single My Love Is Music, produced by Didier Marouani. The group signed also Eros Ramazzotti and released his hit single Una Storia Importante.Musical reach.Carrere UK went on to help develop album selling artists for the Carrere label worldwide with groups like Demon, Rage, and Jim Capaldi.

A batboy may also lay out the equipment and mud the baseballs to be used in the game.Mascots and batboys had both been part of baseball since the 1880s.Perhaps the most famous mascot/batboy was Eddie Bennett, who was supposedly hired as a mascot by the Chicago White Sox at the urging of Happy Felsch in 1919, a tale Eddie told often but no White Sox player ever corroborated. After the 1919 World Series scandal, he was hired by the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1920. When the Dodgers lost the 1920 World Series to the Cleveland Indians, some suggested the four straight losses on the road were due to leaving Bennett behind. He then served for almost 12 years as mascot/batboy for the New York Yankees.Uniforms.Batboys typically wear the same uniform design as their associated team. They will also usually wear a batting helmet to protect them from flying balls or bats.During any given major league game, both the home and visiting team batboys will be drawn from the city where the game is taking place (batboys typically do not travel on the road with their team, unless they are relatives of a player). Home batboys often have regular jobs with a team, and thus may wear their first names on their uniforms; visiting teams, on the other hand, usually do not know who will be serving as their batboys on the road, and thus will send uniforms of various sizes to accommodate batboys of varying heights and weights.A batboy may be provided his own number, but will usually wear 00 or \'BB\' in its place. If a batboy uniform does not have a first name on it, it will usually have the term \'BAT BOY\' or no name at all.Batboys Who Went on to Become Major League Baseball Players.Drew Storen of the Washington Nationals was a Batboy for the Montreal Expos.Jesse Litsch who pitched for the Toronto Blue Jays, was a Batboy for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in 2001 & 2002.Batboys in popular culture.The batboy, Bobby Savoy, is a supporting character in the 1984 film, The Natural.

His father was a gospel musician, and his uncle, LeRoy McCauley, was a part-time blues musician.Kelly\'s own interest in and talent for performing music were on display at an early age; he was playing guitar by the age of seven, despite never having had a formal lesson. Then, at the age of 10, Kelly performed blues for the first time at a Chicago school. As a teenager, he sat in at various clubs on Chicago\'s South Side and later appeared both as a solo artist and as a sideman in those clubs, backing such artists as the West-Side singer Mary Lane when he was 15. It was during this time that Kelly developed his unique ringing guitar sound, which raised his profile among members of Chicago\'s blues community.Early career.Kelly experimented with disco music during the late 1970s, but he had rekindled his interest in blues music by the end of the decade. Major influences on Kelly\'s playing style during this stage of his musical development included B.B. King, Muddy Waters, and Johnny Christian.In 1987, Kelly was invited to become a member of saxophonist A.C. Reed\'s Sparkplugs. Kelly\'s tenure with this group influenced his vocal style, while allowing him to refine his guitar skills, and provided him with road experience.After playing with Reed\'s band for three years, however, Kelly decided to strike out on his own. One reason for this decision was his eagerness to cultivate his own style, which has come to be characterized as a mixture of electric blues, R&B, funk, and disco. Kelly\'s urge to leave Reed\'s band also stemmed from his desire to adapt his blues playing to the perceived tastes of a particular audience. With regard to the latter point, Kelly has said, If the older folks come in, I want to take them back to the Delta blues. When the middle-aged folks come in, they just want to hear regular-type blues. If a younger crowd comes in, they want to hear up-to-date type blues.Rise to prominence.Kelly formed the Backstreet Blues Band soon after he ended his tenure with Reed, and signed a recording contract with the Vienna, Austria-based Wolf Records International in 1992. Members of Kelly\'s band included John Primer on guitar; David Honeyboy on harmonica; Eddie Shaw on the saxophone; Erskine Johnson on the keyboard; and Johnny Reed playing bass.In 1994, Kelly and his band had a breakthrough when his debut album, Call Me, earned critical acclaim and introduced Kelly to audiences beyond the Chicago area. The album went on to win the Best Album of 1994 (New Recording) as well as the Living Blues Award for Best Contemporary Blues Album in 1995.The following year, Kelly released Joyriding in the Subway, which featured assistance on lyrics and vocals by Vivian Kelly, Vance Kelly\'s daughter. As with Kelly\'s debut outing, Joyriding in the Subway also included the guitarwork of John Primer, bass playing of Johnny Reed, and keyboard music of Erskine Johnson. Critics largely praised the album and noted its stylistic breadth, citing influences on the songs such as A.C. Reed, Tyrone Davis, and Little Milton.Recent activities.Kelly has worked steadily since these two hit releases of the 1990s, producing a string of well-received albums that showcased his signature mix of blues, soul, and funk styles. He continues to record with the Backstreet Blues Band, most recently releasing the album Bluebird on October 2008. He has also played at numerous blues gatherings, including the annual Chicago Blues Festival. Between 1999 and 2002, Kelly took part in three separate European concert tours.While Kelly remains relatively unknown outside of the Chicago blues community, his fan base is loyal and has expanded considerably over the years. His daughter, Vivian Kelly, is a blues musician in her own right who released her debut album, Hit Me Up, on October 10, 2006.A musical documentary, Someplace Else, made by film makers Kai-Duc Luong and Avisheh Mohsenin, portraying Kelly and featuring many of his trademark songs, was released in 2008 and played at international film festivals such as the Hawaii International Film Festival, Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival and Rhode Island International Film Festival.'),(21902549,'Eric_Rignot','Eric Rignot.Eric Rignot is Professor of Earth system science at the University of California, Irvine, and principal scientist for the Radar Science and Engineering Section at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.Work.He is a principal investigator on several NASA-funded projects to study the mass balance of the Greenland ice sheets and Antarctic ice sheets by using radar interferometry and other methods; the interactions of ice shelves with the ocean; and the dynamic retreat of Patagonian glaciers.

They won the Hall Radar Award for 2010 and were the most Shazamed band of 2009.In February 2010, the band played venues around the UK on the 2010 NME Awards Tour alongside The Maccabees, Bombay Bicycle Club and The Big Pink, going on to play support band for Florence and the Machine\'s 2010 Cosmic Love tour. In June 2010 they played as one of the support bands for Kings of Leon in Hyde Park, London.On May 7, 2010, they appeared on Friday Night with Jonathan Ross, where they performed Best Friend. Their debut album was officially released on June 7, 2010, on Moshi Moshi and Island Records. The album contained the singles Let\'s Go Surfing, Best Friend, Me and the Moon and Forever and Ever, Amen as well as Down By The Water, which had previously been released as part of the band\'s Summertime! EP. On September 16, 2010, it was announced on the band\'s Facebook page and website that guitarist Adam Kessler had left the band.The Drums released the single The New World on April 11, 2011, with proceeds going to Japan disaster relief efforts.For their second LP, the band recorded quickly, again self-producing, often laying down tracks spontaneously in singer Jonny Pierces kitchen. They released Portamento on September 5, 2011. The album title has a deeper meaning for Pierce, as he describes, Jacob and I meeting as young boys with a shared love for Kraftwerk and Anything Box and Wendy Carlos, and these were all synth pioneers, and a common feature on old analogue systems was Portamento. The band has also revealed that they almost split at the end of June due to stylistic disagreements. Jacob explained, I think our band is kind of fragile and probably on the verge of breaking up pretty constantly and I say that seriously and jokingly at the same time.In 2011, Jonny Pierce co-wrote In The Middle (I Met You There) with Brooklyn artist Matthew Dear for his EP Headcage. His writing credits also include You Gave Me Nothing and Lose It (In the End) which are included in Mark Ronson\'s album Record Collection.After Portamento\'s world tour ended in late 2012, there were unannounced tensions between the group, Third founding member Connor Hanwick leaving, and exhaustion almost causing a break-up of the group. The Drums remained dormant for the most part during 2013, but had occasional performances throughout most of that year.In November 2012, Jonny Pierce announced he would be releasing a solo album in 2013 but The Drums decided to come back after a near breakup. Now The Drums were made up of founding members Jonny Pierce and Jacob Graham.The Drums made their American television debut on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon on February 15, 2012. MTV gave the band a celebrity chart special on MTV HD channel in May 2012, where Pierce and Graham introduced their favourite videos and bands as well as some of their own videos.On February 16, 2014, The Drums posted, celebrating the only way we know how. Album 3 is finished. on their official Facebook page.On July 17, 2014, The Drums announced that their third studio album would be called Encyclopedia and would be released September 23, 2014. In an interview with Billboard Magazine, they stated that he and Graham were ready to come back together and give The Drums another try. They holed up in a lakeside cabin in upstate New York and went crazy, says Graham. That\'s when it occurred to me that we can have fun with this and make a record that\'s interesting and bizarre.\' The resulting cathartic collection of tracks departs from the Drums\' signature tonal palette, as Graham calls it. With taut, spindly guitar lines, liberal sprinklings of tambourine, and uptempo kick drums that belie the brooding, thoughtful content matter of songs like Best Friend.On August 20, 2014, they released their new single I Can\'t Pretend. It was met with much more positive responses compared to previous single Magic Mountain.Influences.The band cite their major influences as Beach Boys, The Wake, The Smiths, Joy Division/New Order, The Tough Alliance, The Legends, The Shangri-las, Starflyer 59, Joy Electric, The Embassy and Orange Juice.Graham also mentions that reverb in general has played a major role in their sound: ...If reverb didn\'t exist we wouldn\'t have bothered trying to start a band.Solo projects.Both members of The Drums have announced solo records in the works for release in 2013. Jonathan under the name Jonny Pierce, and Jacob as Cascading Slopes. In December, Pierce said in an interview with NME I wanted to be as self-indulgent as possible with this album. This is pop done the way I think it should be done. The album was never released however. Instead, Jonny Pierce announced that The Drums had entered the studio and wanted to release a Drums record instead. Cascading Slopes completed the album Towards a Quaker View of Synthesizers in 2013 and it was released in the fall through Plastiq Musiq. Graham described the musical approach on that album, saying The concept is to write very simple, personal, folk songs but to do it with only old, analog synthesizers.Touring members.Charles Russell Narwold  Guitar, bass (20122013)Myles Matheny  Backing vocals, bass, guitar (20112012)Danny Lee Allen  Drums (2011present)Colin - Guitar, bass, backing vocals (2012present)Tom Haslow  Guitar (2010, 2014)'),(26109211,'BenchWarmers_DVD_Magazine','BenchWarmers DVD Magazine.BenchWarmers DVD Magazine is a platform for independent artists and musicians, produced by Tane at NodCraft.com.

BenchWarmers is now in its 9th volume (released December 2009), with an expanded concept and increased scope of musicians, artists, and customers.Volumes 1 and 2 were produced from the NodCraft home office, followed by partial outsourcing of replication for Volumes 35, and finally a fully packaged, commercial product in Volumes 69. Joe Schmo and Tane still provide graffiti footage, but others such as 14-2-1, Nonecantest.com, Atlanta Bench, Sone1, FR8Man, Justin Porter, and The Savage Land have joined in. For Volume 6, Crow provided footage for a tribute to fallen artist HEIST. The art concept has also expanded, with an animated film, King Rust, by Matt Maloney featured in Volume 6, productions from Better Days and Agency Films in Volume 7, and short films by Patrick Boivin in Volume 8. Even the cover art has gone national, with five covers designed by Lee Wilkie who has created for Akademiks, G-Unit, and others.The rise of BenchWarmers DVD Magazine also shows in its music. Maintane continues to provide music production, while Volume 3 brought the addition of West coast musicians 26Hrz and Cawzlos.

As one of the three departments, it was the highest executive institution of the imperial government since the Sui dynasty. Developing from the Shangshu Tai () in the Eastern Han dynasty, the name Sheng () was inherited even though the institution was now removed from the Imperial Court. The head of the Department was known as chancellor but was often absent. The Right and Left Deputy Directors actually shouldered the duties. Beneath the Deputy Directors were the Right and Left Assistant Clerks () who had the Right and Left Excellency () to assist with their daily work and were in charge of the Six Ministries. The general office of the Department of State Affairs was called the Dou Sheng (). The Department controlled the Six Ministries, which included the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Revenue, the Ministry of Rites, the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Justice, and the Ministry of the Public Works. During the Jurchen Jin dynasty, Prince Hailing of Jin abolished the Central Secretariat and the Chancellery in 1156, leaving only the Department of State Affairs in charge of the whole government. This enlarged the power of the emperor, as the Department of State Affairs simply executed the orders of the emperors, who became absolute monarchs. Branch offices of the Department of State Affairs known as the Xing Shangshu Sheng () or Xing Tai () was established in other parts of the empire. During the Yuan dynasty however, the Central Secretariat replaced the Department of State Affairs as the top government agency. The Department of State Affairs was additionally institutionalized in 1270, but was soon abolished in 1272. The head of the Department was normally a single Director (). It was established again in 1287 and 1309, but was likewise abolished in 1291 and 1311 respectively, after which the Central Secretariat alone served. The Department of State Affairs was established in these short periods to deal with financial affairs such as during the New Deals of Klg Khan (Emperor Wuzong), who also changed the branch offices of the Central Secretariat (i.e. the Branch Secretariats) to those of the Department of State Affairs or Xing Shangshu Sheng before it was changed back by his successor Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan (Emperor Renzong). The early Ming dynasty adopted the Yuan Central Secretariat, but the Department of State Affairs was never again established. The abolishment of the Central Secretariat by the Ming in 1380 marked the end of the Three Departments system.'),(22289707,'List_of_Ukrainian_submissions_for_the_Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film','List of Ukrainian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film.Ukraine has submitted films for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film since 1997.

A Slavic settlement was founded in the Middle Ages and existed until the early Ottoman rule of Bulgaria.Elin Pelin (then Novoseltsi) became to emerge as a local cultural and trade centre during the Bulgarian National Revival. In 1881, after the Liberation of Bulgaria, it was proclaimed the administrative centre of a district. Novoseltsi continued to grow in importance after the construction of the SofiaSaranbey (now Septemvri) railway line and the establishment of the Izida ceramic factory, the first in the country. A class school and a chitalishte were founded in the late 19th century. Novoseltsi was renamed Elin Pelin in honour of the noted writer of the same name (born in the nearby village of Bailovo) in 1950 and was proclaimed a town in 1960.The area of Elin Pelin is one of the best preserved centres of the traditional ethnocultural subgroup of the Bulgarian people, the Shopi, including its characteristic vernacular, the white clothing and the characteristic dances, songs and humour.

It is officially located at Pineaire Drive, Executive (formerly Grant) Avenue, and Long Island Avenue near Deer Park, New York. The actual location is in West Brentwood, New York.History.Deer Park, sometimes mentioned as Deerpark, station was previously located at the bridge over New York State Route 231, until it was moved as part of a major reconstruction project of the line at Ronkonkoma, Central Islip, Brentwood, Deer Park, and Wyandanch. The original station was built in 1842, then rebuilt in 1884, and again 1936 for the bridge over Deer Park Avenue (NY 231 did not exist at the time). The 1987-built station was built close to the former Pine Aire station near the Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center (see below), served as a replacement for both stations, and was also originally planned also to replace Brentwood Station until public opposition from Brentwood thwarted that proposal. As a result, some people refer to it as Pine Aire station rather than its given name. In the process of reconstruction, a former one-lane bridge was blocked off.Pineaire station.Pineaire (or Pine Aire) was a station stop along the Ronkonkoma Branch of the Long Island Rail Road in West Brentwood, New York. It was located east of the Pilgrim State Hospital Spur than the currently combined Deer Park-Pineaire complex. In fact it was located on the east side of Sagtikos State Parkway on the opposite side of the intersection of Pine Aire Drive (formerly Edgewood Road) and Manatuck Boulevard. The station first opened around 1915 near the former Thompson\'s Station across from a freight spur, and was finally closed around October 1986, when the two stations were being combined into one.Pilgrim State Hospital station.The former Pilgrim State Hospital station is located within Pilgrim State Psychiatric Center in West Brentwood, at the end of a spur leading south to the main line. The station was opened during the early-20th Century and closed in 1978. The remains of the station can be found where G Road becomes Suffolk County Road 106 on the southwest corner of the Sagtikos State Parkway underpass.Edgewood station.Nearly a century before the current Deer Park station was built, another LIRR station was built between the former Deer Park and Pine Aire Stations in the same area named Edgewood Station. The station was a two-story wooden depot built in 1892 on Grant Avenue by a developer, but originally only existed as a signal stop. Service began to decline by June 1911 and it was closed down in 1914. Local residents used the station for scrap lumber. By the 1940s it became the site of the spur for Edgewood State Hospital., which began just west of the current Deer Park station and ran parallel to the west side of Grant Avenue. The hospital closed in 1971, and was demolished in 1988. While the existing Deer Park station is located on the west side of Executive Boulevard, the site of Edgewood Station was on the east side of Grand Avenue and is occupied by a miniature golf course today.Platforms and tracks.The station has two high-level side platforms, each 12 cars long. The north platform, next to Track 1, is generally used by westbound or New York City-bound trains. The south platform, next to Track 2, is generally used by eastbound trains. However, trains in either direction can use either track. The Main Line has two tracks here.'),(39853371,'Beighton_Junction','Beighton Junction.Beighton Junction is a set of railway junctions near Beighton on the border between Derbyshire and South Yorkshire, England.Scope.The term Beighton Junction has been used in a narrow sense to encompass either one, two or three junctions, according to author\'s purposes, or even as a shorthand for Beighton Junction Signalbox.This complex evolution is addressed by the accompanying Route Diagram Beighton Junction detail.This article treats these junctions as the lynch pin of a complex interweaving triangular network of lines, stretching over two miles from Killamarsh in the south to station in the north west and to in the north east. That triangle as a whole is addressed by the accompanying Route Diagram Beighton Junction.Initial simplicity.The MSLR\'s Beighton Branch and the original Beighton Junction opened to passenger traffic on 12 February 1849. The branch and junction joined the MSLR\'s east-west main line to the Midland Railway\'s erstwhile North Midland Railway line from to which still runs south-north along the valley of the River Rother. The MS&LR\'s station opened at the same time.The MS&LR line had been promoted by the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway (S&LJ). The first sod was ceremonially cut at High Hazles (nowadays spelled High Hazels and better known as Darnall) in eastern Sheffield on 15 October 1846, to the customary celebrations. The S&LJ and other associated lines were amalgamated in 1847 to form the MS&LR.The junction made it possible to run trains from Sheffield eastwards, then turn southwards. At the time the modern line directly south from Sheffield was some way from becoming a financial and engineering possibility. The Midland Railway (MR) allowed MS&L trains to run south two stops beyond Beighton Junction to Eckington where passengers had to change for Chesterfield and beyond.This essentially local scheme continued for forty years. It was condemned to remain local in scope by the opening in 1870 of what was to become known as the New Road direct from Sheffield through Bradway Tunnel and. This New Road led to the Midland Line along the Rother Valley becoming known among railwaymen as the Old Road. Some attempts were made to run through trains from the MS&L, notably to London, but these more often fell foul of railway politics than operating or financial difficulties. In essence, the MS&L was a provincial railway with ambitions but no cash, the Midland and the LNWR had the lines to the south and the whip hand.The Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway.The MS&LR was extremely ambitious. On 11 July 1889 its Derbyshire Lines Bill was passed by the Lords and by the following January contracts were let for a new line to be built from Beighton to Chesterfield. On 7 February 1890 the first sod was cut at Beighton.Naturally, the Midland objected, both in parliament and elsewhere.On 9 May 1890 Parliament granted the MS&L powers to extend the Chesterfield branch southwards to the new main line at Heath, thereby forming a loop.The gateway to this frenetic activity was the MS&L\'s new Beighton Junction. The Midland\'s ire must be understood not in the trivial loss of transfer passenger traffic at Eckington, but in the consequent opening of the Nottinghamshire/Derbyshire coalfield to railway competition. From 1891 to 1894 no fewer than seventeen new colliery branches were opened by the MS&L off the lines catalogued above, most leading to pits already served by the Midland. One such was the Holbrook Colliery Branch which left the new southbound MS&L main line merely yards from their new Beighton Junction.This new Beighton Junction proved to be the springboard for yet more ambition. Later in the 1890s the MS&L sets its sights on getting to London under its own steam and built the London Extension south from Annesley to. The MS&LR became the GCR and the London Extension became the Great Central Main Line. MS&L locals to Killamarsh, coals from Holbrook Colliery and crack expresses from Marylebone to Sheffield Victoria, all were made possible by the MS&LR\'s junction, the second at Beighton.The Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway.In the 1880s a grandiose scheme was formulated to build a railway from Coast to Coast, i.e. from near Warrington on the emerging Manchester Ship Canal (not actually on the coast, but near enough for sloganising purposes) to a wholly new port near Sutton-on-Sea in Lincolnshire. In November 1890 detailed plans for this new line - to be known as the Lancashire, Derbyshire and East Coast Railway (LD&ECR) - were made public, they included a branch from Langwith to Beighton, aiming at the expanding heavy industry in Sheffield. Notice seeking to put a Bill before Parliament was given in the same month.Effective groundwork had been done so that only 37 petitions objecting to the new line were tabled. Most of those from landowners were successfully dealt with (i.e. bought out or mitigated, so they were withdrawn) and those from the CLC, LNWR and GN&GEJR were subsequently withdrawn when they became satisfied that the proposed line was either neutral or advantageous to them. The GER went one step further, changing from opponents to supporters, as they saw that the line could give them access to Sheffield and to North Midlands coal.The MS&L\'s opposition was by far the strongest, not least because the proposed line broadly paralleled their established main line from East to West and would potentially be a direct competitor. Their rumbustious leader, Watkin, described the proposed line as one of the maddest schemes ever presented to Parliament. So little opposition, and that from a partial source, meant the Bill sailed through Parliament and received Royal Assent on 5 August 1891, the biggest line authorised in a single session.That was the easy bit. Investors prepared to back the scheme were thin on the ground and by the Autumn of 1891 the decision was taken to start building eastwards from Chesterfield to meet the GN&GEJR at Pyewipe Junction west of Lincoln and northwards from Langwith Junction towards Beighton, which would occasionally be referred to as the Sheffield Branch but much more widely as the Beighton Branch. As things turned out they were the only two stretches of line which would be built.As late as 1896 the LD&ECR still had no means of getting into Sheffield and the Beighton Branch still looked set to end in a marsh next to the Rother. In that year a scheme was passed by Parliament permitting the building of the Sheffield District Railway (SDR) from a point on the LD&ECR\'s Beighton Branch near Barlborough to Attercliffe in Sheffield\'s northern industrial heartland. This route was both difficult and expensive at a time when the LD&ECR was having trouble financing its Chesterfield-Lincoln main line. The driving forces behind the SDR were Sheffield businessmen and the company was legally independent, but the LD&ECR saw it as a child of its own. Despite the lack of finances the Duke of Norfolk cut the first sod in Attercliffe in 1896.The East-North junction at Beighton, usually referred to in sources simply as Beighton Junction, was the third Beighton Junction, as shown on the Beighton Junction Detail route diagram. It was formally opened by the Duke of Norfolk on 21 May 1900, along with the SDR. Goods and mineral traffic started on 28 May and passengers on 30 May 1900.The Great Central Railway.In 1897 the MS&LR changed its name to the Great Central Railway (GCR) in anticipation of reaching in 1899. Its change of name and scale did not dim its expansionist character.The GCR had the last laugh over the Midland regarding the LD&ECR. Having bitterly opposed the LD&ECR (...one of the maddest schemes...) and suffered the Midland\'s ploy of enabling the LD&ECR to get to the heart of Sheffield under the GCR\'s noses the GCR now owned the usurper and had its trains running over Midland metals to Attercliffe and points nearby. Whatever scores may have been settled the GCR had certainly scotched the competitive threat posed by the LD&ECR and went on to make significant use of its metals, most notably as the Nottinghamshire Coalfield spread eastwards.Other lines.Significantly, no roads ran along the valley bottom, and few crossed it, as the river was and is prone to flooding. The natural course of the Rother was slow and meandering, straight out of school geography textbook diagrams. The North Midland Old Road did some straightening, but by virtue of coming first it took the easiest and driest line.The lines which undertook the most preventive work were the Waleswood Curve and the LD&ECR, the former in particular diverted a horseshoe bend in the river to end up with just one crossing - Bedgreave Viaduct - instead of many.The GCR became a significant victim of the river, in 1937, for example, Beighton station flooded above rail level and by 1950 was forced to undertake platform raising and other works, partly as a result of flood damage and partly as a preventative measure.As was often the case, railways addressed the same transport needs as canals and faced similar obstacles. The Chesterfield Canal sought to move heavy goods between early industrial North Derbyshire and South Yorkshire and to connect both with the North Sea via the River Trent. Its most famous traffic - Anston stone for the rebuilding of the Houses of Parliament following a disastrous fire in 1834 - was transferred from narrowboats to seagoing craft and taken thereby to the Thames. The MS&LR had a similar objective in building the Waleswood Curve, as well as the additional spur of meeting a clamour of traffic in the opposite direction - iron ore for Staveley Works.Both the canal and the railway faced the problem of climbing eastwards out of the Rother valley. James Brindley made best use of the technology of his day to build Norwood Locks, immediately followed by Norwood Tunnel which emerged within a stone\'s throw of what would later be the MS&LR main line near Kiveton Park Colliery. The Waleswood Curve took advantage of later technology and greater resources. It smoothed out the same climb by taking a longer route. It, too, had a tunnel - Waleswood Tunnel - which was a mere long compared with Brindley\'s. Railways in general rendered most narrow canals uneconomic, but the Chesterfield Canal suffered an additional blow when Norwood Tunnel collapsed in 1907.The five railway branch lines varied considerably.The Crown Paper Mills branch first appeared on OS maps in 18991900. The branch turned a sharp right angle north eastwards off the GCR Beighton Branch immediately north west of the third Beighton Station. It served the Crown Paper Mills until the 1940s, after which the mills\' site was used by George Slater\'s scrap metal business. OS maps show rail connections to the site until the 1970s. No evidence suggests that this scrapyard dismantled railway locomotives.The North Staveley Curve turned sharply eastwards off the MR\'s Old Road between the 1849 Beighton Junction and Beighton Viaduct, which carries the MS&LR\'s east-west main line over the Rother and the MR\'s Old Road. The branch was so named because it served North Staveley Colliery, Aston. The line was laid when the company bought and developed Aston Colliery in the 1860s. The 1854 OS map shows the colliery and a tramway running southwards, seemingly to end at right angles to the MS&LR main line. 187792 OS maps show the developed position, with the tramroad from the colliery crossing the MS&LR at right angles to enter coal handling facilities immediately south thereof, on Midland metals. Later in the colliery\'s life the tramway was replaced by a conveyor belt. The coal handling facilities in later years consisted of a hopper, from which coal was dropped into railway wagons. The North Staveley Curve appears to have joined the MS&LR at North Staveley Junction a short distance west of the coal handling facilities, opened on 1 January 1870 but later sources make no mention of North Staveley Junction referring consistently to Brookhouse Junction as described below. The North Staveley Colliery Company was intimately connected with the Staveley Coal and Iron Company, based in Staveley, ten miles to the south. When the company bought the mine the MS&LR\'s Derbyshire Lines were far into the future so the Midland Railway was the natural partner to transport the coal southwards, as they already served the ironworks on a large scale. The Midland System Diagrams of 1918 show North Staveley Colliery as Aston Colliery.Beighton Colliery (or sometimes Beighton Pit) appears on OS maps from 1905 to 1924 to 1967. The colliery is shown on the Midland Railway System Maps dated 1918 as being served by the joint MR & GCR Beighton Colliery Branch, which ran east-west immediately south of the GCR Sheffield-Worksop line. This branch connected to the North Staveley Curve in such a way that Midland trains travelling between the Midland\'s Old Road and the colliery would have to reverse into and out of branch. GCR trains could proceed straight ahead to the eastern end of the North Staveley Curve and on towards Worksop by what would later be known as Brookhouse Junction.The same maps show that the later Brookhouse Colliery and its coke works connected both to the North Staveley Curve and to the Sheffield-Retford line, the latter connection having a signalbox for that purpose. Sinking Brookhouse Colliery commenced in 1929 and eventually joined Aston\'s North Staveley Colliery workings underground, leading to the latter\'s closure. The hopper mentioned above in connection with North Staveley Colliery appears to have been used to handle Brookhouse Colliery\'s output in later years. Trains from the ex-GCR east-west line reversed empty wagons under the hopper after which they were allowed to run forward under gravity whilst coal was dropped into them.Brookhouse coking plant ceased production in October 1981 and Brookhouse Colliery closed on 26 October 1985. Brookhouse Colliery signalbox followed the next year.Glovers Siding served Glover\'s Victoria Flour Mill (sometimes referred to as Valley Mills), a prominent Killamarsh structure between the GCR and LD&ECR embankments. The single track branch turned south west off the LD&ECR line approximately opposite Killamarsh North Junction. It immediately fell very steeply to ground level then ran south to the mill, making yet another crossing of the Rother in the process. The mill and branch do not appear on the 1905 OS map, but are shown on the 1924 version.The Midland Railway\'s Killamarsh Branch opened in 1869, being extended to Kiveton Park in 1878; it survived in part until 1972 and has since been lifted. It turned east off the Midland\'s Old Road at Killamarsh Branch Junction, passed under a farm track then crossed what was initially open water meadows. When the MS&LR built their Derbyshire Lines and the LD&ECR their Beighton Branch (see above) both crossed the Killamarsh Branch by overbridges and the GCR Walewood Curve ran away northeastwards on an embankment, resulting in a complete character transformation of the first couple of hundred yards of the branch. This was heightened after the Second World War when T W Ward\'s Killamarsh Scrapyard opened immediately east of the LD&ECR overbridge. This scrapyard was connected to the branch and specialised in cutting up railway rolling stock, notably wagons and locomotives, for which it became famous in railway enthusiast circles. Truly remarkable footage of this scrapyard in 1960 and 1964 is available on DVD. On-line sources of the size and detail of locomotive disposals differ but give an idea of the scale of the operation. Many references to Wards of Killamarsh confuse the site with the company\'s other scrapyard in this article\'s area, Wards of Beighton. The two were about a mile and a half apart.Restorers of the Chesterfield Canal have considered using the tunnel, which survives, as a means of getting under the M1, the original canal tunnel having collapsed in part in 1907. To the naked eye this seems an obvious solution, but the railway tunnel, like most of the branch extension, is on slope steep by railway standards. As canals require level pounds at least one lock would be necessary inside the tunnel, which would involve digging out the bottom and threatening both the structure\'s integrity and the M1 above.The final branch in this article\'s area is the MS&LR\'s Holbrook Colliery Branch. Holbrook No. 1 Colliery was situated immediately west of the Midland\'s Killamarsh station. The Midland had served the colliery for many years when the MS&LR built their branch to the colliery as part of their Derbyshire Lines expansion in the 1890s, described above. The single track branch left the MS&LR\'s Beighton Branch a short distance south of the third and final Beighton station and ran parallel to what would become the GCML as far as its lattice girder overbridge over the Midland\'s Old Road, after which it ran parallel to the Old Road to the colliery. The pit closed in 1944 and was demolished in 1961, though most of the ex-GCR branch was lifted before then.A train using the branch was involved in a fatal accident on 11 February 1942. Metal sheets in a wagon being shunted became dislodged and protruded into the path of a troop train on the adjacent Down (northbound) ex-GCR main line. The metal sliced into some of the coaches killing several sailors and injuring more.A Wagon Works first appeared on OS maps of the area in 1923. It was situated in the V of the 1849 Beighton Junction, accessed from the GCR Beighton Branch from the north west, though it could be accessed from the MR Old Road by turning from south to north west, then reversing. Intriguingly, the map also shows a building labelled Engine Shed. Staying on the same website, by 1956 the site was labelled Wagon Repair Works. The access lines appear unchanged from the 1923 map.At some point after the Second World War the wagon works were taken over by the scrap merchant T W Ward and used for breaking up redundant railway rolling stock, including locomotives, with railway literature referring to the site as both wagon works and Ward\'s. The location is close to the V of the junction, as can be seen from the attached image, where the photographer was on a diverted train travelling from the Old Road to the Beighton Branch, with the Old Road clearly visible to the right of the yard, and Brookhouse Colliery and coke ovens in the distance, north east of camera. Like its fellow site at Killamarsh, it became a focus of interest for railway enthusiasts, but was much less accessible without trespass, with the result that fewer photographs survive.The DVD cited in the context of Wards at Killamarsh also contains images of Ward\'s at Beighton, but the commentary is confusing. Similarly, on-line sources of the size and detail of locomotive disposals differ but give an idea of the scale of the operation. Many references to Wards at Beighton confuse the site with the company\'s other scrapyard in this article\'s area, Wards at Killamarsh. The two were about a mile and a half apart.A goods yard, elsewhere referred to as Beighton Yard, first appeared on OS maps of the area in 195051. It was situated in the V of Woodhouse Junction, where the ex-MS&LR main line and their Beighton Branch diverged from 1849 onwards. This is at the extreme top left of the Beighton Branch Route Diagram accompanying this article. The OS map was published in 1950, but the map\'s data may be from before the Second World War. The yard connected to the Beighton Branch at both ends. The accompanying image of a V2 shows it heading northwestwards along the Beighton Branch immediately before Woodhouse Junction, with tracks to Worksop heading eastwards at the extreme bottom left of the image. As a footnote, this image shows a rare out of gauge trap point, two such have been installed new on the Welsh Highland Railway to protect the Cae Pawb level crossing with the ex-Cambrian Railway line at Porthmadog.A further goods yard, built by the LD&ECR and known as Beighton Sidings, existed immediately south of the 1900 Beighton Junction, next the LD&ECR running lines on their eastern side. The sidings were controlled by a classic LD&ECR signalbox known as Beighton Sidings, situated approximately south of the junction, which closed on 13 October 1952 and was demolished in 1957. The Midland Railway System Maps show the northern end of the yard as connecting directly onto the North Staveley Curve, as do OS maps. A remnant can be seen below the signalbox in the signalbox diagram of the ex-MR Beighton Junction signalbox, which closed in 1982.Lines and Junctions.This narrative has described many lines which interlock in the article\'s area. Some of these lines are short and self-contained whilst others travel further afield and link to others the length and breadth of the land.An online database exists which gives railway engineer\'s line reference codes (ELR codes) for all lines in England, Scotland and Wales. Readers may see these stencilled or labelled on structures such as bridges, e.g. BAC3/25 uniquely identifies a bridge in Clowne, Derbyshire, as being bridge number 25 on line BAC3. The data behind this coding structure is authoritative, detailed and informative. It is also used within the railway industry. The reader can freely access the database and use the codes to see associated detail.An online database exists which gives railway lines and distances for most lines in England, Scotland and Wales.

The curve never carried local passenger traffic.The LD&ECR Beighton Branch.Regular, timetabled east-west traffic along the Sheffield Victoria to Worksop line is outside the scope of this article, except in times of strain or exceptional load, when the LD&ECR\'s Beighton Branch served as a diversionary route, in conjunction with the LD&ECR main line east of Langwith Junction. Some east coast Summer holiday traffic from Manchester Central and Sheffield Victoria was routed via the 1892 MS&LR Beighton Junction, Killamarsh North Junction, Killamarsh South Junction, the LD&ECR Beighton Branch, Langwith Junction and Pyewipe Junction until 1964.The Sheffield-Worksop line had two long-distance services, the Master Cutler from 1958 and for many years the daily - boat train. This latter was occasionally diverted using the same route, bringing March Britannias through the remains of.The Beighton Branch also served as an overflow and diversionary route for the GCML, with northbound trains leaving the latter at Kirkby South Junction and travelling up the Leen Valley Extension through to Langwith Junction then to Sheffield using the route described above, regaining the GCML at Killamarsh North Junction. Southbound trains reversed the process.A notable variation on this routing was the Starlight Express sleeping car service between Marylebone and Glasgow St Enoch and Stirling which ran from 1962 to 1964 to free up the West Coast Main Line for electrification work. In 1963 at least, some of these trains did not regain the GCML at Killamarsh North Junction, but ran through to the 1900 Beighton Junction with the Old Road then turned north to Masborough, the Settle-Carlisle Line and the Glasgow and South Western Railway route into Scotland. Other trains in this quite extensive service ran straight up the GCML, through the 1892 Beighton Junction and headed northwards via Sheffield Victoria.From 1988 into the early 1990s a preservation group named the Rother Valley Railway had a brief existence on the site of station. The line had three locomotives on loan, a five-ton steam crane and a membership of over eighty. Although the line featured in a two-page article in Railway Magazine in 1990 little seems to have happened and the society faded away.The Midland Railway Old Road.After 1870, when the Midland Railway opened its New Road direct between Sheffield to Chesterfield via Bradway Tunnel the Old Road running north-south through the 1849 and 1900 Beighton Junctions became a passenger backwater. Apart from diversions and specials there was only a very thin stopping service.These services had fizzled out by 1954, the stations on the Old Road having closed in dribs and drabs in the early 1950s, with the last to close on 5 July 1954, but that was on the cessation of services along the Clowne Branch; Old Road stopping services appear to have ended on 1 February 1954.In 1965 a connecting spur was installed between the former Nunnery Colliery Branch and the ex-MS&LR Main Line a quarter of a mile east of Sheffield Victoria. This allowed trains from Sheffield Midland to run north eastwards onto ex-MS&LR metals and vice versa. From 4 October of that year most services which had run to and from the east into Sheffield Victoria were diverted to Sheffield Midland. This had no direct, daily effect on Beighton Junction, but it did open up the possibility of diverted trains using Beighton as a diversionary route. Diverted southbound trains could travel northeast from Sheffield Midland onto the ex-MS&LR line, east to Woodhouse Junction, southeast to the Beighton Junction 1849 then southwards down the Old Road to regain their conventional route at Tapton Junction north of Chesterfield. Northbound trains could reverse the process.Such diversions occurred from time to time, with the complete closure of the New Road from 17 August to 7 September 1969 for the demolition of Broomhouse Tunnel providing a prolonged example.Football specials for Hillsborough Football ground ran to from the Midland Main Line and places such as Birmingham ran for many years, being able to run northwards up the old Road then turn west (left) at the 1849 Beighton Junction, straight through Sheffield Victoria to Wadsley Bridge. This was doubly more convenient than running through Sheffield Midland as it avoided a reversal at Nunnery Junction and avoided the relatively congested New Road and Sheffield Midland itself.The Great Central Main Line.The greatest passenger flow through Beighton Junction was West-South.This meant the Great Central could only compete on two fronts - price and speed.To compete on price they had to undercut the Midland or carry more passengers or some combination of the two. By 1905 Great Central express services were quicker from London to Sheffield than the Midland, but at the expense of having to run five coach trains including a restaurant car. Much enterprise was shown in the Edwardian period to attract customers to the new line, but in modern business parlance it lacked a unique selling point.By 1922 the Midland\'s London services were quicker than the Great Central\'s, typically by 15 to 30 minutesOn Saturday 13 September 1958 the last Master Cutler ran via Beighton Junction, being recast as a diesel-hauled Pullman service from Sheffield Victoria to via on and from the following Monday.The last year-round daytime services from Marylebone through Beighton Junction to Sheffield and Manchester ran on Saturday 2 January 1960. From the following Monday they were either withdrawn or truncated at. The line\'s last named train, the -Marylebone South Yorkshireman was replaced by a service in two parts. The first ran from via to Sheffield Midland where, after a considerable wait it was joined by a portion from. The combined train then ran to.Stopping trains on the GCML north of Nottingham last ran on 3 March 1963.This left four regular, year-round timetabled passenger trains through the 1892 Beighton Junction up to the closure of the GCML as a through route on 5 September 1966.This last, in the early hours of 4 September 1966, was the final Sheffield Victoria-Marylebone via ex-GCR metals. Further south, near Kirkby Bentinck, the line was severed almost immediately, with colour light signals still glowing red, though traffic to Arkwright Colliery via Duckmanton Junction continued for some years.With this closure also ended the GCR\'s other notable passenger role - excursions and special traffic. The line\'s relative over-capacity, its long-distance connections and its access to Wembley Stadium made special traffic to hockey, football and Rugby League matches significant business, especially after World War II.The Manchester Central-Marylebone on 4 September 1966 was the last timetabled train south onto the GCML via the 1891 Beighton Junction, but the final passenger train of all passed in 1977 or 1978 when the Royal Train travelled northwards along the Old Road, turned left (westwards) at the 1849 Beighton Junction, came to a halt in the site of Beighton\'s third station, then reversed gingerly over the 1891 Beighton Junction onto the Up line of the remaining stump of the GCML, coming to a halt in the vicinity of the lattice girder bridge over the Old Road. The view westwards from the carriages can hardly have been edifying, as the erstwhile Down line was occupied by redundant goods wagons as far as the eye could see.Other lines.None of the other lines described above ever carried a passenger service.Freight.As with passenger traffic, the dominant freight flows were between the south, southeast & east and the west, northwest & north. Once again, the exception was the Waleswood Curve.The Waleswood Curve.The Staveley Coal and Iron Company lobbied for the curve as a means of getting coal and North Lincolnshire iron ore to their works at Staveley. This traffic waned as other sources were found and the Appleby-Frodingham Steel Company scooped up most of the ore at source. By the 1960s traffic was thin, with photographic evidence suggesting that one daily train - a New Clee-Banbury express fish - provided the line\'s principal traffic. That this traffic survived into the 1960s is perhaps surprising, as similar trains, collectively known as Whitland Fish, ran between the same places, but diagrammed via the five miles shorter route via Lincoln, Pyewipe Junction, the LD&ECR Main Line to Clipstone East Junction then down the ex-Mansfield Railway line to the GCML at Kirkby South Junction.When the ex-GCR Main Line closed as a through route in 1966 the Waleswood Curve lost any possibility of through traffic to or from the south. Trains running up the ex-LD&ECR Beighton Branch could use the curve to head east, though there was little historical precedent for this, Beighton Branch traffic had most commonly aimed at Sheffield or Mottram, with some in early post-war days going further northwest to Gorton, Deansgate and Walton-on-the-Hill, Liverpool.The LD&ECR Beighton Branch.Traditionally the Beighton Branch had two types of freight traffic, coal and through services, usually diversionary or relief traffic off the ex-GCR main line. This latter disappeared when the main line closed, leaving coal, plus small amounts of residual traffic such as the Saturdays Only Wadsley Bridge Batchelors canning factory to Oddicroft Metal Box factory at Sutton-in-Ashfield which ran along the Beighton Branch then the Leen Valley Extension until the former closed as a through route, whereafter it ran via, the new MR-LD&ECR spur south of Creswell, through the site of then onto the Leen Valley extension right up to the latter\'s closure on 27 May 1968.Coal remained King, but his domain was shrinking. By the 1960s the Beighton Branch had three working collieries - Westthorpe (near Spinkhill), Creswell and Langwith. Coal also arrived on the branch from pits along the Leen Valley Extension and pits east of Langwith Junction, such as Warsop. That, too was changing, closures and rationalisation on the Leen Valley Extension reduced that source. For example, Pleasley Colliery joined underground with Shirebrook Colliery and started sending its coal to the surface via Shirebrook, displacing the railway traffic from ex-GNR to ex-Midland metals, away from the Beighton Branch.Changes in demand also influenced the flow of coal. By the 1960s household coal was in decline and power station coal was on the rise. In 1959, for example, High Marnham Power Station opened and immediately created a new demand in a new location. This was followed in the 1960s by larger new power stations in the Trent Valley whose demand for coal necessitated new technology, which was provided in notable forms such as TOPS and computer timetabled Merry-go-round trains (mgr). West Burton Power Station\'s power signalbox was opened in 1965, in preparation for stockpiling coal on a wholly different scale from traditional working.A wholly new connection was built across fields near the Norwood Crossings south of Creswell (not near to or to be confused with Norwood Tunnel or Norwood End No.10 Tunnel, which are near Killamarsh). This enabled coal from pits such as Warsop to travel along the first, easily graded couple of miles of the Beighton Branch then switch east to the ex-MR line and head for Worksop. This opened on 9 January 1967. The Beighton Branch was severed and lifted from that point to the north end of Spinkhill Tunnel. The M1 breached the trackbed near Barlborough and Creswell\'s coal went out exclusively over ex-Midland metals, with Langwith\'s following in 1969. Westthorpe\'s coal went northwards along the remaining northern end of the branch, which was renamed the Westhorpe Colliery Branch and given the Engineer\'s Code WEC1. This history is traced in the route diagram associated with the Beighton Branch article. The quantities from Westthorpe did not justify retaining the Waleswood Curve, which was also closed on 9 January 1967, so Westthorpe\'s coal worked along the ex-LD&ECR to Beighton Junction (1900), immediately across the Old Road via Beighton Junction (1849), northwest along the 1849 MS&LR Beighton Branch crossing Beighton Junction (1891) in the process, running round in sidings between Woodhouse Junction signalbox and to head off east to Cottam or West Burton. This arrangement lasted until Westthorpe pit closed in 1984, after which point the branch was cut back to a siding.Severing the Beighton Branch led to a re-routing of west to southeast coal traffic from Treeton Colliery which travelled to Rotherwood Sidings then reversed southeast to Woodhouse Junction, Beighton Junction 1849 then Beighton Junction 1900 along the Beighton Branch. That subsequently travelled to Rotherwood and reversed directly along the MS&L Main Line to, bypassing all Beighton Junctions. It then turned south along the now Robin Hood Line then south east along the new chord to gain its original route. This would have been shorter by the full Beighton Branch, but as it was an mgr train it would have been very demanding uphill to Clowne.The Great Central Main Line.The ex-GCR Main Line was severed in 1966. It was subsequently lifted north of Nottingham as far as Duckmanton North Junction. The line from there to Beighton Junction (1891) was retained as a long branch to serve Arkwright Colliery, west of Chesterfield. The detailed and eventful history of the lines serving Arkwright is given the Duckmanton Junction article; as far as Beighton Junction is concerned the Beighton-Arkwright branch was in turn severed in 1982, ending any possibility of revenue earning traffic from the remaining stump through Beighton Junction. The line was duly closed north of Staveley and track from the site of through the site of was lifted in February 1983.The sidings on both sides of the original Beighton Branch south of the site of Beighton Station were thinned out to leave a single siding, as can be seen in the foreground of the following linked image of a nine coach train headed by a Class 47 heading south towards the 1849 Junction which is behind the camera. In due course the siding also disappeared, leaving two plain lines southeast to the 1849 Beighton Junction; this remains the situation in 2013.The Midland Railway Old Road.Goods traffic along the Old Road through Beighton Junction 1900 and Beighton Junction 1849 was always frequent, varied and wide-ranging.It is easy for modern observers of Britain\'s predominantly passenger railway to forget that until the 1950s goods traffic was dominant on the railways. This dominance was exaggerated on the Old Road because the ex-Midland main line split at Tapton Junction north of Chesterfield into the New Road heading northwest to Sheffield and the Old Road heading northeast to Rotherham. Most passenger traffic took the New Road and most freight traffic took the Old Road. The dominance was exaggerated yet further because Beighton Junction lay between the iron and steelmaking areas of Sheffield, Rotherham and Teesside on the one hand and the North Derbyshire coalfield and the iron ore quarries of Northamptonshire on the other.In 1972 Peter Hogarth wrote the \'old road\' carries a still considerable volume of freight traffic, running for most of its length through a barren and malodorous wasteland of chemical plants, coking ovens and steel works.From the mid-1950s to the late 1990s British railway goods traffic fell off a cliff. From then up to 2013 it made something of a recovery, albeit from a very low base.Up to the early 1960s the dominant traffic along the Old Road through Beighton Junction was coal and iron ore carried on slow, steam-hauled, loose-coupled trains with corresponding empties in the opposite direction. Mineral traffic was more of a natural traffic for railways than goods in wagon-loads or less where transhipment, marshalling, remarshalling and final transhipment time and costs were prohibitive.The history of freight traffic through Beighton Junction in this period of great change can be summarised in four words: fewer, faster, heavier and further.Iron ore traffic from the Wellingborough area of Northamptonshire along the ex-Midland main line and along the Old Road through Beighton Junction fell away sharply in the 1960s, largely as a result of changes in steel production techniques rendering Northamptonshire ore unsuitable. Although iron concentrate - a substitute for traditional iron ore - began to be produced as a substitute for traditional ore it was sent to the Potteries and not through Beighton.These trends are described above in the context of the LD&ECR and apply also to the Old Road.A little-sung use of the Old Road, usually passing straight through Beighton Junction 1849 was for running in and acceptance trials for stock, especially those built or renovated at Derby or Doncaster. Some early HSTs used the route in this way.Modern times.TO EDIT IN::: In 2013 specials and excursions still sometimes travel this way.'),(16844103,'George_B._Daniels','George B.

A founding member of the hip hop group, the Wu-Tang Clan, GZA is known as the group\'s spiritual head, being both the oldest and the first within the group to receive a record deal. He has appeared on his fellow Clan members\' solo projects, and since the release of his critically acclaimed solo album Liquid Swords (1995), he has maintained a successful solo career.In 2012, The Source placed him on their list of the Top 50 Lyricists of All Time.An analysis of GZA\'s lyrics found that he has the second largest vocabulary in hip hop music, behind Aesop Rock, in a sample of 75 rappers. The Wu-Tang Clan, as a collective, and several of its individual members were also in the top 10.Early life.Gary Grice developed an interest in hip-hop by attending block parties as a child in the early 1970s. He formed a three-man group with his cousins, Robert Diggs and Russell Jones, who would later be known as RZA and Ol\' Dirty Bastard, respectively. The group, FOI: Force of the Imperial Master, saw the three rapping and DJing, switching off names and performing local shows; since they lived in different boroughs, GZA and Ol\' Dirty would travel from Brooklyn out to Staten Island to meet up with their cousin RZA, after which the three would travel across New York City and challenge other MCs to battles. After some years of this, GZA was signed to Cold Chillin\' Records as a solo artist under the name The Genius. He put together an album called Words from the Genius, produced mostly by Easy Mo Bee, but after it failed to selland his rocky experience on tourGrice became fed up and asked for release from the label.Wu-Tang Clan.After joining the Wu-Tang Clan, a group of nine which included himself, RZA and ODB, GZA boasted some high-profile appearances on the group\'s debut album, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), including a solo track, Clan in da Front. This, combined with appearances on other Clan albums such as \' and Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... brought him much recognition and respect (more than he achieved solo as The Genius). These guest appearances were followed up in 1995 with GZA\'s sophomore solo effort on Geffen Records, Liquid Swords, produced entirely by RZA; the album was met with critical and commercial acclaim, and is still considered one of the best albums to come out of the Wu-Tang camp; in 1998, the album was selected as one of The Source Magazine\'s 100 Best Rap Albums of all time. At this time he also began his career as a Director of music videos, mentored by his then-personal manager Geoffrey L. Garfield who had a background in video production. With Garfield as writer and producer, GZA directed three music videos for his own CD for the songs Liquid Swords, Cold World and Shadow Boxin\'/4th Chamber, the latter being chosen by The Source magazine as one of the Top 5 Videos of the Year. GZA and Garfield also produced videos for Shabazz the Disciple, Ghostface Killah and Case. The pair operated GZA Entertainment which had subsidiaries for music publishing, video production, merchandising, and album art. GZA\'s company commissioned renowned comic book artist from Milestone Media Denys Cowan to design the legendary Liquid Swords cover art of Wu-Tang members fighting their enemies on a chess board suspended in outer space.Solo career.After appearing on the Wu-Tang Clan\'s second album, Wu-Tang Forever, GZA released Beneath the Surface in 1999. Grice put in appearances on The W, Iron Flag and some of his group members\' solo projects, but did not release another of his own until 2002 with Legend of the Liquid Sword. The album was received well by critics, but did not achieve commercial success, failing to go Gold as his previous release had. GZA spent 2004 touring, both solo and with the Clan, and made an appearance with RZA in Jim Jarmusch\'s film Coffee and Cigarettes, opposite Bill Murray.In 2005, GZA and DJ Muggs (the producer for hip-hop group Cypress Hill) released the LP Grandmasters. Muggs provided all the production for the album, which saw GZA using chess as a metaphor for the rap game. The album received positive reviews and modest commercial success. He then partook in the recording of groupmate Raekwon\'s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II, originally stating that he was heavily featured along with Inspectah Deck, though he was later unsure about the status of his presence on the project.In 2007, GZA teamed up with the Wu-Tang Clan to record the group album 8 Diagrams, and in the ensuing controversy, defended both Raekwon and Ghostface Killah\'s rights to speak their mind, and RZA\'s production job on the album. In the summer of 2008, he released the album Pro Tools which featured production from Black Milk and past collaborators Jay Waxxx Garfield, RZA, Mathematics and True Master. A very controversial song on the album was entitled Paper Plates a smooth flowing response aimed at rival rapper 50 Cent. After the release GZA toured various parts of Europe on a Liquid Swords Tour where he performed songs from Liquid Swords as well as Pro Tools. He later toured parts of the USA. GZA also stated his wish to record another full album with RZA.In 2009, GZA made appearances on two more Wu-Tang Clan albums. The first being on a song entitled Stomp da Roach on the album Dopium, by fellow clan member U-God, the other being appearances on the tracks We Will Rob You, Rockstars and House of Flying Daggers, on Raekwon\'s album Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... Pt. II. The Genius continued to tour during the year, appearing on the Rock The Bells lineup and also performing at the NXNE music festival in Canada. RZA confirmed that he will be producing Liquid Swords II: The Return of the Shadowboxer. GZA also made an appearance in a video for Devendra Banhart\'s song titled Baby. GZA confirmed that Killah Priest will perform a solo song on Liquid Swords II, similar to B.I.B.L.E. (Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth), to act as the closer to the album just like the original.GZA has also begun work on a concept album called Dark Matter, which is based on a journey through time and space. He will also be appearing on the upcoming collaboration album between producers Pete Rock & DJ Premier V.S. album appearing on Premier\'s track. In a recent lecture, GZA also hinted at the possibility of an album without a Parental Advisory sticker, after denouncing profanity in hip-hop as filler which is not needed. GZA is currently working to improve science education in New York City through a partnership with Teachers College, Columbia University Professor, Christopher Emdin and website, Rap Genius. This initiative motivates young people to learn science through creating raps and engaging in a rap competition.'),(21888047,'Far_East_Bank','Far East Bank.Far East Bank () was a bank in Hong Kong. It is now merged to Bank of East Asia.It was founded in 1959 by Mr. Deacon Chiu (), the founder of Far East Holdings. It is started as a small bank in Tsuen Wan by collecting deposits from farmers. In 1960s, it suffered heavily from heavy lending to property sector and fraud. In 1965, bank runs happened in several small and medium banks in Hong Kong, which finally triggered off stock market crash in 1965. Ordered by British Hong Kong government, the bank was aided by The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation until it was acquired by First National City Bank in 1969. In 1992, the bank was acquired by First Pacific and merged to Hong Nin Savings Bank to form First Pacific Bank.In 2000, First Pacific Bank was acquired by Bank of East Asia.

Offutt Air Force Base is named in his honor.Early life.Offutt was born in Omaha, Nebraska on October 26, 1894. He attended Omaha Central High School and graduated from the Lawrenceville Preparatory School in 1913. He graduated from Yale University in 1917; while at Yale, he was a member of the Varsity Club, Glee Club, Alpha Delta Phi fraternity, and was a Y track man, winning his honors in the high hurdles. He was also inducted into the Phi Beta Kappa Society, an organization which recognizes high academic achievement.Military career.In 1916, while still at Yale, Offutt served as a company supply sergeant for the Yale Field Artillery on a summer deployment to Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania. Later in 1916, he entered officer training at Fort Snelling, Minnesota, but after a month he asked to be transferred to aviation. He was one of 300 candidates sent from the United States to Canada to be trained by the Royal Flying Corps Canada. He then went to Fort Worth, Texas, where he received his commission as a First Lieutenant in the Aviation Section, U.S. Signal Corps in November 1916.In January 1917 he went to England for further training, after which he was assigned duties as a ferry pilot attached to the Royal Flying Corps. As a ferry pilot, his duties were to deliver aircraft from factories in England to bases at the front in France. In the course of these duties, he crossed the English Channel almost daily.Death and afterward.Offutt died on August 13, 1918 from injuries received while flying at Valheureux, France. It is unknown whether his death resulted from enemy action or from an aircraft accident.On May 10, 1924 the landing field at Fort Crook, near Omaha, Nebraska, was renamed Offutt Field in his honor. The dedication ceremony, attended by Offutt\'s mother and brother, featured an aerial salute from 19 planes which circled the field; then-Major (United States) Charles Tinker commanded seven of the planes which flew from Fort Riley, Kansas and dropped a dedicatory wreath to highlight the ceremony.On January 13, 1948 both the airfield and Fort Crook were renamed Offutt Air Force Base.'),(3489138,'Janice_Hahn','Janice Hahn.Janice Kay Hahn (born March 30, 1952) is the U.S. Representative from California\'s 44th congressional district and a member of the Democratic Party. She was previously a Los Angeles City Councilwoman representing the 15th district from 2001 to 2011. From 1997 to 1999 she served as an elected representative on the Los Angeles Charter Reform Commission.On July 12, 2011, Hahn won a special election for Congress to fill the seat vacated by Democrat Jane Harman. She defeated Republican Craig Huey, a Tea Party-backed direct marketer from the Torrance area, with 55 percent of the vote to Huey\'s 45 percent. In February 2015, Hahn announced she was retiring from Congress to run for the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors.Early life, education, and business career.Hahn was born in Los Angeles, California, and was raised in a politically involved family. She is the daughter of Ramona Belle (ne Fox) and Kenneth Frederick Hahn, a 40-year Los Angeles County Supervisor who started his career in elective politics as a Los Angeles City Councilman. Her uncle, Gordon Hahn, was a member of the California Assembly and a Los Angeles City Councilman from the late 1940s to the early 1960s. Her brother, James Hahn, served as Los Angeles City Controller from 1981 to 1985, City Attorney from 1985 until 2001, and Mayor of Los Angeles from 2001 until 2005. Hahn\'s maternal grandparents served as missionaries in Japan in the 1920s and 1930s.Hahn attended Abilene Christian University in Texas, earning a bachelor of science in education in 1974. She taught at the Good News Academy, a private school in Westchester from 1974 to 1978. Her other work in the private sector has included Public Affairs Region Manager at Southern California Edison from 1995 to 2000; Vice President for Prudential Securities in Public Finance, Director of Community Outreach for Western Waste Industries, and Director of Marketing for the Alexander Haagen Company.Local commissions.Hahn was elected to represent the Fifteenth District on the Los Angeles Charter Reform Commission, serving from 1997 to 1999. As a Commissioner, she fought for many of the reforms included in the new charter, including Area Planning Commissions, local representation on the citizen commissions governing Los Angeles International Airport and the Port of Los Angeles, and a system of neighborhood councils.1998 congressional election.In 1998, U.S. Congresswoman Jane Harman declined to run for re-election, choosing instead to run for Governor of California. Hahn then won the Democratic nomination to succeed Harman, but lost the general election to Republican State Assemblyman Steven T. Kuykendall 49%-47%.Los Angeles City Council (2001-2011).Hahn served on the Los Angeles City Council, representing the 15th District, from 2001 to 2011. The 15th District encompasses the San Pedro Harbor and includes the ethnically diverse communities of Harbor City, Harbor Gateway, San Pedro, Watts and Wilmington. She was reelected to her third and final term in November 2009.She has been called one of the most pro-labor members of the City Council, and a consistent opponent of layoffs and furloughs for city workers. Hahn walked the picket lines with unionized dockworkers in 2002. After the Bush administration suggested it would intervene in the labor dispute by using government troops to operate the ports, Hahn urged non-intervention. \'There\'s no room for the federal government. There\'s only one reason for them to get involved, and that\'s to break the union,\' she said. She was the leading force on the City Council behind both the passage of a living wage ordinance for the hotel workers along Century Boulevard near Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) and the provision of improved health benefits to LAX employees.Hahn cites her efforts to clean up the Port of Los Angeles as one of her main accomplishments while on the City Council. The 2006 Clean Air Action Plan, which she and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa pushed forward, set a goal of reducing pollution by 45 percent within five years and shifted the movement of goods at the ports to off-peak traffic hours. Hahn also supported the addition of the Clean Trucks Program that requires the 16,000 diesel trucks serving the ports meet 2007 EPA emission standards within five years. She has noted that the ports have been Southern California\'s largest emitter of greenhouse gasses and diesel emissions and that the Clean Trucks Program also provides for improved working conditions, wages and benefits for port truckers. Prior to the Clean Air Action Plan, she had already shifted about 35% of goods to be moved during off-peak hours. Hahn also helped advance redevelopment projects at the Port of Los Angeles in both San Pedro and Wilmington.On the City Council, Hahn was a major proponent of gang prevention, intervention, and suppression programs. She led the campaign to pass Measure A, which would have dedicated a sustainable revenue stream for those programs, but fell just shy of the two thirds percentage needed to pass. On a smaller level, she expanded the Gang Alternatives Program to all elementary schools in her district.2010 Lieutenant Gubernatorial election.Hahn ran for California Lieutenant Governor but was defeated in the primary by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, finishing second in a field of three candidates.Elections.On February 7, 2011, Hahn announced her intention to run for the U.S. House of Representatives in the special election to fill California\'s 36th Congressional District seat vacated by Congresswoman Jane Harman\'s departure to head the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.Hahn was one of sixteen candidates from all parties who competed in the special election primary on May 17, 2011. She finished first with 24 percent of the vote; Republican Craig Huey finished second with 22 percent. Because no candidate received more than 50 percent, Hahn and Huey, the top two finishers, faced off in a special runoff election on July 12. Many had expected California Secretary of State Debra Bowen to secure one of the top two spots, but Bowen finished in third place.The Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, AFLCIO, endorsed Hahn in March 2011, a move the Daily Breeze called significant because of the fundraising and get out the vote power of the large organization. As of March 23, 2011, Hahn had received endorsements from Senator Dianne Feinstein, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, Los Angeles County Sheriff Lee Baca, California Assembly Speaker John A. Prez, California State Senator Ted Lieu, Torrance Firefighters Association Local 1138, and other notable figures such as former LA Laker Earvin Magic Johnson and environmentalist and actor Ed Begley, Jr.. On April 25, 2011, Hahn secured the endorsement of the Los Angeles Times. Following her victory in the primary, Hahn was endorsed by California Democrats Governor Jerry Brown, Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom (who defeated Hahn in the 2010 primary race for Lieutenant Governor), House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer of Maryland. Emily\'s List, an organization that supports women candidates who support abortion rights also endorsed Hahn. On June 5, 2011, Hahn was officially endorsed by primary opponent Marcy Winograd, California State Controller John Chiang, Assemblyman Warren Furutani and Assemblywoman Betsy Butler, as well as the gun-control group Brady Campaign.A poll conducted by the Daily Kos and Service Employees International Union shortly before the July 2011 election had Hahn in the lead over Huey by 8 points, (52 percent to 44 percent) with 4 percent undecided. Her final margin of victory was 9 points, 54.56 percent to 45.44.After redistricting dismantled her old district, Hahn decided to run in the newly redrawn 44th district, which included her home in San Pedro. That district had previously been the 37th, represented by fellow Democratic Congresswoman Laura Richardson. The California Democratic Party endorsed Hahn. In the all-party primary (created as a result of Proposition 14), she finished first over Richardson by a wide margin, taking 60 percent of the vote to Richardson\'s 40 percent. This was all the more remarkable since Hahn was running in territory that was more than 60 percent new to her. In the general election, Hahn defeated Richardson with 60.2 percent of the vote to Richardson\'s 39.7 percent.Political positions.Hahn voted on Nov. 19, 2015, for HR 4038, legislation that would effectively halt the resettlement of refugees from Syria and Iraq to the United States.Recognition.Some of the awards received by Hahn include the Rosa Parks Award from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the Bold Vision Award from the San Pedro Chamber of Commerce, the Public Service Award from the African-American Chamber of Commerce, the Recognition Award from the Harbor Area Gang Alternative Program, and enshrinement on the Promenade of Prominence in Watts.Personal life.Hahn is a lifelong resident of Los Angeles and lives in San Pedro.

In 1871, he was summoned to the Weimar Saxon-Grand Ducal Art School to teach landscape painting as a replacement for Max Schmidt, who had left to take another position. Three years later, he received a permanent appointment. He was head of the art department from 1876 to 1881, but grew tired of his administrative duties and returned to teaching. His best-known students were Christian Rohlfs, Hanns Diehl, and Franz Bunke.He was one of the founders of German Impressionism. After trying out several styles during his early years, he became attracted to the plein-air painting of the French Barbizon School. Through his friendship with Alfred Lichtwark, the first Director of the Kunsthalle Hamburg, he spent some time there, painting scenes of the harbor and the North Sea. From 1893, he was a member of the Munich Secession and, from 1902, the Berlin Secession.A street in Weimar has been named the Theodor-Hagen-Weg in his honor and his home (now Trierer Strae 36) is a municipal monument.'),(13243765,'Dykanka_Raion','Dykanka Raion.Dykanskyi Raion (; translit.: Dykans\'kyi Raion) is a raion (district) in the central Ukrainian province of Poltava.

He first became known with his singles Silk and Love is a circle which he performed in 2007 during the Coca-Cola Sound Wave Festival. He has since edited three albums.Early life.Monsieur Minimal was born in Northern Greece in 1980. He has since lived in several parts of Greece. He has been living in Athens since 2009. He grew hearing and playing music with several adolescent bands. After high school he studied and graduated from the Department of Electrical Engineering of Kavalas Institute of Technology. He entered music for good when he started studying music technology and production at the music school of Salonica under the guidance of Demetrius Adam. He has been writing music as Monsieur Minimal for the last 6 years.Career.His first public appearance was in 2007. He was one of the most successful competitors of the Coca-Cola Sound Wave Festival, with his songs Silk and Love Is A Circle.His first official release was in the City Campers compilation (The Sound Of Everything) in 2008.First Album.Monsieur Minimals debut album, titled Lollipop, was released in 2008 by The Sound Of Everything Records and received impressive reviews from press and radio, while it soon became a best seller of the Greek indie scene. His music, defined mainly as indie pop but with a lot of electronic influences and elements, expressed through simple, beautiful melodies and sweet pop vocals, made this album a hit across a wide range of radio stations in Greece. Following the hype from his album, Status magazine, one of the most popular male magazines in Greece, included him in its annual contest as a candidate in the category face of the year 2009.After the massive exposure he gets from most of the Greek Radio and TV stations, the first international breakthrough comes thanks to a TV ad! Smile one of the most popular singles of the album, is selected by Safeway, the third largest supermarket chainstores in USA and Canada for their official TV campaign. The album gets the attention of international music blogs and soon tracks from the album travel to France, Germany, Italy while Love Story becomes a massive radio hit in Turkey. Citroen also used the song Smile for their TV campaign in Greece.Second Album.Following the success of the debut album and the unprecedented hype he receives from the Greek media as a new talent,the National Greek Tourism Organization selects the track Lollipop for their international campaign consisting of 12 promotional videos in several languages.In 2010 Monsieur Minimal records his second album, titled Pasta Flora in Greek. His music preserves the same successful ingredients and the lyrics convey the same meaning: Love! Dimitra Galani, one of the greatest female singers of Greece with a career spanning more than 30 years in the music industry, sings one of the album songs titled Mia Zoi. The album becomes an instant success in Greece and Monsieur Minimal now enjoys popularity from a much wider audience in his home country, while receiving a daily airplay for the biggest music radio stations of Greece.Third Album.2012 finds Monsieur Minimal writing new songs for his third album Minimal to Maximal, which is in English again, just like his debut album Lollipop. The first small but intriguing taste of the musical puzzle of the third album, came with the Digital Love EP (released in May 2012), including four new and previously unreleased tracks, including the hit single Bitter (Bitter Official Video) in collaboration with Hiras.Minimal to Maximal includes 16 tracks in total, featuring all 4 tracks of the Digital Love EP, and divided in two parts.

The stable came about as a result of the WWF\'s purchase of World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in March 2001. The Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) name was brought in later to help boost the presence of WCW after the original promotion closed in April 2001. Today, only certain members of The Alliance remains under their respective WWE contracts in various roles such as backstage staff (Arn Anderson and Billy Kidman), referees (Charles Robinson), and on-air performers (Booker T, Christian, The Dudley Boyz, Rhyno, Rob Van Dam, Stephanie McMahon, and William Regal).History.The original plan was for the WWF-owned WCW to be a babyface group, led by Shane McMahon (who was the owner of WCW in the angle) to go against the heel owner of the World Wrestling Federation Vince McMahon. During May and June 2001, wrestlers identified as being under contract to WCW (such as Lance Storm and Hugh Morrus) invaded World Wrestling Federation programming, by making several run-ins. The ultimate goal, reportedly, was for WCW to take over one of the WWF\'s two primary programs, either Raw or SmackDown!, and rebrand it as its own separate entity. To test the waters for this, the final twenty minutes of the July 2 Raw telecast was given over to WCW, which brought in its own commentators (Scott Hudson and Arn Anderson), ring announcer (Stacy Keibler), referee (Nick Patrick), ring apron, and Chyron graphics, to present a match between Booker T and Buff Bagwell for Booker\'s WCW World Championship (which he had won on the final episode of Nitro). This continued on SmackDown!, where Gregory Helms lost the WCW Cruiserweight Championship against Billy Kidman and Booker defended the WCW Championship against Diamond Dallas Page.The Booker/Bagwell title match, however, was very poorly received both by television viewers and the live crowd in the arena, with the two other WCW matches receiving a similar reaction. The decision was thus made to make WCW a heel group who was out to destroy the WWF. On July 9 on Raw, when then-face WCW owner Shane was scheduled to face Page in a street fight, the two instead attacked The Undertaker, turning Shane heel (Page had already debuted in WWF as a heel, as part of a stalker angle with Undertaker and his wife).Later that night, during a tag team match pitting Chris Jericho and Kane against WCW\'s Lance Storm and Mike Awesome, former Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) stars Rob Van Dam and Tommy Dreamer interfered and attacked Jericho and Kane. Justin Credible, Raven, Tazz, Rhyno, and The Dudley Boyz (all ECW Alumni) came to the ring shortly thereafter and joined Van Dam and Dreamer in attacking Jericho and Kane, and Raw color commentator Paul Heyman announced that together, he was forming an ECW team to take on the feuding WWF and WCW factions.Later that evening, Vince and Shane agreed to join forces to take out ECW once and for all in a twenty-man brawl between Team WWF (Hardcore Holly, Big Show, APA, and Billy Gunn) and Team WCW (Chris Kanyon, Chuck Palumbo, Sean O\'Haire, Shawn Stasiak, and Mark Jindrak). When WCW and ECW faced off in the ring, however, they instead congratulated each other and attacked the WWF wrestlers. It was revealed that ECW had merged with WCW to form a supergroup to more effectively challenge the WWF and that Stephanie McMahon had purchased the defunct company. This combined group was originally referred to as WECW on WCW.com and then as WCW/ECW, but the rights to ECW\'s assets (including the use of its name on-air by the WWF) were still being debated in bankruptcy court, so the name of the group was shortened to The Coalition and later The Alliance.At WWF Invasion, Team WCW/ECW (Booker T, Diamond Dallas Page, Rhyno, and The Dudley Boyz) defeated Team WWF (Stone Cold Steve Austin, The Undertaker, Kane, Kurt Angle, and Chris Jericho) in a ten-man tag team match billed as the Inaugural Brawl. During the match, Austin turned heel and joined the Alliance, helping them score the victory.Over the next few months, the two sides fought back and forth. Except for a few wrestlers (X-Factor and Christian, for example), every feud was a WWF wrestler(s) versus an Alliance wrestler(s). Ten combined WWF and WCW championships were defended among all the wrestlers in the various feuds. Over time, numerous WWF superstars would defect to the Alliance, including Test, William Regal, Ivory, and Christian. Former ECW and WCW wrestler Steven Richards would belatedly defect to the Alliance, bringing WCW alumni KroniK with him. In return, Chuck Palumbo and Torrie Wilson defected from the Alliance to the WWF. Kurt Angle also defected to the Alliance on the October 29 edition of Raw.In late October, both sides agreed to end things once and for all. A Winner Take All classic Survivor Series elimination match was set for the Survivor Series pay-per-view, with the losing company going out of business forever. In addition, two title unification matches were signed- the WCW World Tag Team Championship and the WWF Tag Team Championship were to be unified in a match between the Dudley Boyz and the Hardy Boyz, while Edge and Test would meet in a match to unify Edge\'s WCW United States Championship with Test\'s WWF Intercontinental Championship. Further, 20 WWF and Alliance members would square off in what was called the Immunity Battle Royal, with the winner of the match keeping his job for one year regardless of whether his side won or not.In the end, Team WWF (The Rock, Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show) defeated Team Alliance (Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, and Shane McMahon) when Angle double-crossed the Alliance by turning on Austin while he was fighting The Rock during the closing stages of the match. The Rock then pinned Austin, thus putting the Alliance out of business. Earlier in the night, The Dudley Boyz defeated the Hardy Boyz to unify the tag team championships while Edge defeated Test to win the Intercontinental Championship. Despite his loss, Test entered the Immunity Battle Royal later that night and won.With the Alliance\'s loss, nearly all of their members lost their jobs following the match. Exceptions were made for Stone Cold Steve Austin, the WWF Champion; the Dudley Boyz, who won the Tag Team Championship; Stacy Keibler, the Dudleys\' manager; Rob Van Dam, who at the time was the Hardcore Champion; Christian, who at the time was the European Champion; Immunity Battle Royal winner Test; and Alliance commissioner William Regal, who was forced to join the Mr. McMahon Kiss My Ass Club to keep his job. Some of them would be hired back over the next few months, with the majority of them returning when the brand extension began. The WWF Light Heavyweight Championship, which was held at the time by X-Pac, was quietly retired and replaced with WCW\'s Cruiserweight Championship.The next night on Raw, Vince McMahon celebrated his victory by making a slow return to his villain character, aligning himself with the Alliance members that were sticking around. Later that night, he resumed his rivalry with Austin, who turned face by attacking Angle and aligning himself with a returning Ric Flair. After being fired, Shane walked out on his own and congratulated his father for his victory, and spent most of the next eighteen months away from television; he would return to feud with Kane in 2003. Stephanie blamed Shane for everything and was escorted out of the arena by security, but unlike Shane she made a quick return and began appearing again shortly after the return of her then on-screen husband Triple H in January, which led to a three-month-long feud that ended shortly after WrestleMania X8.One of the more important changes was the removal of the WCW branding from The Rock\'s then World Championship. McMahon and Flair decided that, since both world championships had not been unified, a tournament would be set up at Vengeance in December. WWF Champion Austin was to take on Angle while World Champion The Rock was to take on Jericho, with the winners then facing off to become the first Undisputed WWF Champion. Jericho, who had been feuding with The Rock over the WCW Championship leading into Survivor Series and had actually defeated Rock for it on one occasion, won the title again while Austin defeated Angle to retain his WWF Championship. Jericho, thanks to a returning Booker T, defeated Austin to become the first Undisputed WWF Champion.As of, only Stephanie McMahon, Heyman, Christian, Rob Van Dam, Booker T, Regal, Kidman, Anderson, Rhyno and Robinson are still employed by the WWE. Van Dam would then make his return in 2013 Money in the Bank event after his well known success in the ECW brand with Heyman in 2006, while Kidman and Anderson continue to work backstage as well as Regal who would serve as developmental staff for NXT. In addition, Charles Robinson is the only former WCW referee still with the company. Rhyno returned to the WWE in March 2015 and currently performs in the NXT roster. Both Brian Adams and Mike Awesome died in 2007, while Test died in 2009 from drug overdose, as well as Chris Kanyon in 2010 and Sean O\'Haire in September 2014. Hugh Morrus (going under his real name Bill Demott) left the company in March 2015.Other allies. indicates that the performer made their WWF television debut before the formation of the Alliance1 Tommy Dreamer, Rob Van Dam and Paul Heyman appeared on WWF television in 1997, during an ECW invasion'),(22398341,'Fire-safe_polymers','Fire-safe polymers.Fire-safe polymers are polymers that are resistant to degradation at high temperatures. There is need for fire-resistant polymers in the construction of small, enclosed spaces such as skyscrapers, boats, and airplane cabins. In these tight spaces, ability to escape in the event of a fire is compromised, increasing fire risk. In fact, some studies report that about 20% of victims of airplane crashes are killed not by the crash itself but by ensuing fires. Fire-safe polymers also find application as adhesives in aerospace materials, insulation for electronics, and in military materials such as canvas tenting.Some fire-safe polymers naturally exhibit an intrinsic resistance to decomposition, while others are synthesized by incorporating fire-resistant additives and fillers. Current research in developing fire-safe polymers is focused on modifying various properties of the polymers such as ease of ignition, rate of heat release, and the evolution of smoke and toxic gases. Standard methods for testing polymer flammability vary among countries; in the United States common fire tests include the UL 94 small-flame test, the ASTM E 84 Steiner Tunnel, and the ASTM E 622 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) smoke chamber. Research on developing fire-safe polymers with more desirable properties is concentrated at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and at the Federal Aviation Administration where a long-term research program on developing fire-safe polymers was begun in 1995. The Center for UMass/Industry Research on Polymers (CUMIRP) was established in 1980 in Amherst, MA as a concentrated cluster of scientists from both academia and industry for the purpose of polymer science and engineering research.Early History.Controlling the flammability of different materials has been a subject of interest since 450 B.C. when Egyptians attempted to reduce the flammability of wood by soaking it in potassium aluminum sulfate (alum). Between 450 B.C. and the early 20th century, other materials used to reduce the flammability of different materials included mixtures of alum and vinegar; clay and hair; clay and gypsum; alum, ferrous sulfate, and gypsum; and ammonium chloride, ammonium phosphate, borax, and various acids. These early attempts found application in reducing the flammability of wood for military materials, theater curtains, and other textiles, for example. Important milestones during this early work include the first patent for a mixture for controlling flammability issued to Obadiah Wyld in 1735, and the first scientific exploration of controlling flammability, which was undertaken by Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac in 1821.Developments Since WWII.Research on fire-retardant polymers was bolstered by the need for new types of synthetic polymers in World War II. The combination of a halogenated paraffin and antimony oxide was found to be successful as a fire retardant for canvas tenting. Synthesis of polymers, such as polyesters, with fire retardant monomers were also developed around this time. Incorporating flame-resistant additives into polymers became a common and relatively cheap way to reduce the flammability of polymers, while synthesizing intrinsically fire-resistant polymers has remained a more expensive alternative, although the properties of these polymers are usually more efficient at deterring combustion.General Mechanistic Scheme.Traditional polymers decompose under heat and produce combustible products; thus, they are able to originate and easily propagate fire (as shown in Figure 1). The combustion process begins when heating a polymer yields volatile products. If these products are sufficiently concentrated, within the flammability limits, and at a temperature above the ignition temperature, then combustion proceeds. As long as the heat supplied to the polymer remains sufficient to sustain its thermal decomposition at a rate exceeding that required to feed the flame, combustion will continue.Purpose and Methods of Fire-Retardant Systems.The purpose is to control heat below the critical level. To achieve this, one can create an endothermic environment, produce non-combustible products, or add chemicals that would remove fire-propagating radicals (H and OH), to name a few. These specific chemicals can be added into the polymer molecules permanently (see Intrinsically Fire-Resistant Polymers) or as additives and fillers (see Flame-Retardant Additives and Fillers).Role of Oxygen.Oxygen catalyzes the pyrolysis of polymers at low concentration and initiates oxidation at high concentration. Transition concentrations are different for different polymers. (e.g., polypropylene, between 5% and 15%). Additionally, polymers exhibit a structural-dependent relationship with oxygen. Some structures are intrinsically more sensitive to decomposition upon reaction with oxygen. The amount of access that oxygen has to the surface of the polymer also plays a role in polymer combustion. Oxygen is better able to interact with the polymer before a flame has actually been ignited.Role of Heating Rate.In most cases, results from a typical heating rate (e.g. 10/min for mechanical thermal degradation studies) do not differ significantly from those obtained at higher heating rates. The extent of reaction can, however, be influenced by the heating rate. For example, some reactions may not occur with a low heating rate due to evaporation of the products.Role of Pressure.Volatile products are removed more efficiently under low pressure, which means the stability of the polymer might have been compromised. Decreased pressure also slows down decomposition of high boiling products.Intrinsically Fire-Resistant Polymers.The polymers that are most efficient at resisting combustion are those that are synthesized as intrinsically fire-resistant. However, these types of polymers can be difficult as well as costly to synthesize. Modifying different properties of the polymers can increase their intrinsic fire-resistance; increasing rigidity or stiffness, the use of polar monomers, and/or hydrogen bonding between the polymer chains can all enhance fire-resistance.Linear, Single-Stranded Polymers With Cyclic Aromatic Components.Most intrinsically fire-resistant polymers are made by incorporation of aromatic cycles or heterocycles, which lend rigidity and stability to the polymers. Polyimides, polybenzoxazoles (PBOs), polybenzimidazoles, and polybenzthiazoles (PBTs) are examples of polymers made with aromatic heterocycles (Figure 2). Polymers made with aromatic monomers have a tendency to condense into chars upon combustion, decreasing the amount of flammable gas that is released. Syntheses of these types of polymers generally employ prepolymers which are further reacted to form the fire-resistant polymers.Ladder Polymers.Ladder polymers are a subclass of polymers made with aromatic cycles or heterocycles. Ladder polymers generally have one of two types of general structures, as shown in Figure 3.One type of ladder polymer links two polymer chains with periodic covalent bonds. In another type, the ladder polymer consists of a single chain that is double-stranded. Both types of ladder polymers exhibit good resistance to decomposition from heat because the chains do not necessarily fall apart if one covalent bond is broken. However, this makes the processing of ladder polymers difficult because they are not easily melted. These difficulties are compounded because ladder polymers are often highly insoluble.Inorganic and Semiorganic Polymers.Inorganic and semiorganic polymers often employ silicon-nitrogen, boron-nitrogen, and phosphorus-nitrogen monomers. The non-burning characteristics of the inorganic components of these polymers contribute to their controlled flammability. For example, instead of forming toxic, flammable gasses in abundance, polymers prepared with incorporation of cyclotriphosphazene rings give a high char yield upon combustion. Polysialates (polymers containing frameworks of aluminum, oxygen, and silicon) are another type of inorganic polymer that can be thermally stable up to temperatures of 1300-1400C.Flame-Retardant Additives and Fillers.Additives are divided into two basic types depending on the interaction of the additive and polymer. Reactive flame retardants are compounds that are chemically built into the polymer. They usually contain heteroatoms. Additive flame retardants, on the other hand, are compounds that are not covalently bound to the polymer; the flame retardant and the polymer are just physically mixed together.Only a few elements are being widely used in this field: aluminum, phosphorus, nitrogen, antimony, chlorine, bromine, and in specific applications magnesium, zinc and carbon. One prominent advantage of the flame retardants (FRs) derived from these elements is that they are relatively easy to manufacture. They are used in important quantities: in 2013, the world consumption of FRs amounted to around 1.8/2.1 Mio t for 2013 with sales of 4.9/5.2 billion USD. Market studies estimate FRs demand to rise between 5/7 % pa to 2.4/2.6 Mio t until 2016/2018 with estimated sales of 6.1/7.1 billion USD.The most important flame retardants systems used act either in the gas phase where they remove the high energy radicals H and OH from the flame or in the solid phase, where they shield the polymer by forming a charred layer and thus protect the polymer from being attacked by oxygen and heat.Flame retardants based on bromine or chlorine, as well as a number of phosphorus compounds act chemically in the gas phase and are very efficient. Others only act in the condensed phase such as the metal hydroxides (aluminum trihydrate and magnesium hydroxide), metal oxides and salts (zinc borate and zinc oxide, zinc hydroxystannate), as well as expandable graphite and some nanocomposites (see below). Phosphorus and nitrogen compounds are also effective in the condensed phase, and as they also may act in the gas phase, they are quite efficient flame retardants. Overviews of the main flame retardants families, their mode of action and applications are given in. Further handbooks on these topics areA good example for a very efficient phosphorus-based flame retardant system acting in the gas and condensed phases is aluminium diethyl phosphinate in conjunction with synergists such as melamine polyphosphate (MPP) and others. These phosphinates are mainly used to flame retard polyamides (PA) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT) for flame retarded applications in electrical engineering/electronics (E&E).Natural Fiber-Containing Composites.Besides providing satisfactory mechanical properties and renewability, natural fibers are easier to obtain and much cheaper than man-made materials. Moreover, they are more environmentally friendly. Recent research focuses on application of different types of fire retardants during the manufacturing process as well as applications of fire retardants (especially intumescent coatings) at the finishing stage.Nanocomposites.Nanocomposites have become a hotspot in the research of re-safe polymers because of their relatively low cost and high flexibility for multifunctional properties. Gilman and colleagues did the pioneering work by demonstrating the improvement of fire-retardancy by having nanodispersed montmorillonite clay in the polymer matrix. Later, organomodied clays, TiO2 nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, layered double hydroxides, carbon nanotubes and polyhedral silsesquioxanes were proved to work as well. Recent research has suggested that combining nanoparticles with traditional fire retardants (e.g., intumescents) or with surface treatment (e.g., plasma treatment) effectively decreases ammability.Problems With Additives and Fillers.Although effective at reducing flammability, flame-retardant additives and fillers have disadvantages as well. Their poor compatibility, high volatility and other deleterious effects can change properties of polymers. Besides, addition of many fire-retardants produces soot and carbon monoxide during combustion. Halogen-containing materials cause even more concerns on environmental pollution.'),(19246659,'Faroe_Islands_at_the_1992_Summer_Paralympics','Faroe Islands at the 1992 Summer Paralympics.The Faroe Islands competed at the 1992 Summer Paralympics in Barcelona, Spain.

It was the first in the series of three elections held in the 2014, and the major test leading up to the parliamentary elections in July. The political atmosphere was in a crisis that started with the fall of Borut Pahor\'s government, then Janez Jana\'s government in 2013, the latter coming after Jana was accused of corruption. The cabinet of Alenka Bratuek was breaking up, as the former leader of the Positive Slovenia Zoran Jankovi, who was under the suspicion of corruption, announced his candidature for party president, even though the coalition parties threatened to leave the government if he was to be elected, which later he was.The main characteristic of the elections was the participation of several new parties, founded during the recent years of crisis. Verjamem was among the last parties to be founded before the elections, and surprisingly finished in third place, winning one seat in the European Parliament.Opinion polls.Poll results are listed in the table below in reverse chronological order, showing the most recent first. The highest percentage figure in each polling survey is displayed in bold, and the background shaded in the leading party\'s colour. In the instance that there is a tie, then no figure is shaded. The lead column on the right shows the percentage-point difference between the two parties with the highest figures. Poll results use the date the survey\'s fieldwork was done, as opposed to the date of publication. However, if such date is unknown, the date of publication will be given instead.Results.The election was severely won by the right pole parties, winning 5 of the 8 seats for the European People\'s Party (EPP). Igor oltes won one seat for the The GreensEuropean Free Alliance (Greens-EFA), whose member the party became after the election. Ivo Vajgl won a seat for the new Slovenian European party Democratic Party of Pensioners (DeSUS), which became member of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party, after election in the European Parliament. The leader of the Social Democrats (SD) Igor Luki, was not elected in the parliament even though he was the president of the party and its main candidate. He was beaten by Tanja Fajon by preferential voting with 11.691 against 6.882 votes for her party colleague.Aftermath.A candidate for the presidency of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker wished to have a name of the candidate for the new Slovenian commissioner until the 1 of August 2014. A huge debate took place right after the election and was a played a part of the pre-elecion time. Bratuek, who was still a prime minister at the moment, wished to send a name of the candidate by herself, which was strongly opposed by the leader of SMC Miro Cerar. After his victory on the parliamentary elections, he proposed the current commissioner Janez Potonik as a potential common candidate of the government and the potential new coalition parties. The government placed his proposal on the list of candidates along with the Prime Minister Alenka Bratuek (ZaAB), Karl Erjavec (DeSUS-ALDE) and Tanja Fajon (SD-PES). The actual commissioner withdrew his candidature, as he did not agree with the multitued of the candidates. The self nomination of Alenka Bratuek caused even bigger storm in Slovenian political atmosphere, as many saw her move as an act of private interest. Her action is now under investigation by Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia (KPK). Driven by decisive victory on the election to European parliament, the Slovenian MEP\'s members of the EPP, Milan Zver (SDS), Alojz (Lojze) Peterle (NSi), Franc Bogovi (SLS), Romana Tomc (SDS) and Patricija ulin (SDS) wrote a letter of complaint and concern to Jean-Claude Juncker expressing regret as none of the proposed potential commissioner is not a member of the triumphant EPP. Miro Cerar was displeased with the expulsion of Janez Potonik from the race for the European commissioner, and announced his reaction as soon as he will be named and confirmed as a Prime Minister-designate on 25 of August 2014. Cerar, as the newly named Prime Minister-designate, declared his first action will be a letter to Juncker in which he shall consult the candidate for the new leader of European Commission. In the background a big lobbying battle took place, as Tanja Fajon, strongly supported by PES, has been invited to formal conversation with Juncker. Karl Erjavec also announced a meeting with potential leader of the Commission after the appointment of presidents of the European Council on 30 of August. Janez Potonik returned to the race, after SMC refused cooperation with ZaAB in the new coalition, but was soon backed out by the original trio of candidates (Bratuek, Erjavec and Fajon). Prime minister designate Cerar announced his support to Fajon and Erjavec, but ex prime minister Bratuek did not back down and continued lobbying in the European parliament, looking for support among the European parties. Juncker soon named Bratuek a Vice-President of the European Commission designate and a European Commissioner for Energy designate, but she faced big opposition both in European parliament and in Slovenia, as the people did not support her candidature. She faced a hearing in front of the representatives of the European Parliament on 6. of October. European MP\'s were not impressed by her presentation and vision for the Energy Union so they refused her as a candidate for the named position and asked Juncker to replacer her or name her on a new position. Under an investigation of Commission for the Prevention of Corruption of the Republic of Slovenia and huge pressure from Slovenia, Bratuek finally resigned as the candidate for Commissioner from Slovenia on 9. of October 2014. New Cerar\'s government named ex Violeta Bulc, who was confirmed as a candidate for European Commissioner for Transport and later also passed the hearing in front of the European MP\'s. Bulc assumed her new position on 1 of November 2014.'),(10380700,'Trick_%27r_Treat','Trick \'r Treat.Trick \'r Treat is a 2007 American-Canadian anthology horror film written and directed by Michael Dougherty. The film stars Dylan Baker, Brian Cox and Anna Paquin, and centers on four Halloween-related horror stories. One common element that ties the stories together is the presence of Sam, a mysterious child trick-or-treater wearing shabby orange pajamas with a burlap sack over his head, that makes an appearance in all the stories whenever someone breaks Halloween traditions.Despite being delayed for two years and having a very limited theatrical release, the film received much critical acclaim and has since garnered a strong cult following. In October 2013, the filmmakers announced that a sequel, Trick \'r Treat 2, is in the works.Opening.In the fictional Warren Valley, Ohio, Emma (Leslie Bibb) and her holiday-obsessed husband, Henry (Tahmoh Penikett), have set up numerous ghost-scarecrows for Halloween in their yard, although she is mostly uninterested in Halloween. After returning home from a Halloween party, Emma tries to blow out a jack-o\'-lantern, but Henry tells her not to because it is against tradition to extinguish a jack-o\'-lantern on Halloween; she blows it out anyway. While Henry is inside waiting for Emma to take down the decorations, she is murdered by an unknown assailant with a large blade-shaped pumpkin lollipop in front of the kids who were trick-or-treating, who run away in horror. Later, Henry goes outside and notices limbs hanging out of wires. Just then, one of the scarecrows lights up. He approaches it and takes down the cover, only to see Emma\'s decapitated head stuck onto the stick and wrapped in decorative lights, with her limbs chopped off and her mouth stuffed with a large lollipop, and screams in horror.The Principal.Steven Wilkins (Dylan Baker), the town principal, spots his young neighbor Charlie (Brett Kelly) stealing candy from his yard as he returns from the store. Smiling, he places him down at his front door and talks to him about candy and stealing, carving out a jack-o\'-lantern, and he gives him a candy. Charlie eats the candy, which turns out to be poisoned with cyanide, and throws up large amounts of chocolate and blood before he dies. While Wilkins is trying to take Charlie\'s corpse to the backyard to bury it, his doorbell rings. The trick-or-treaters, among them a small boy wearing orange footed pajamas and a burlap sack on his head, take their candy without finding out what Wilkins has done. Wilkins then buries Charlie in his backyard, along with another unknown body, and has a run-in with his neighbor, Mr. Kreeg (Brian Cox), and his dog. After finishing the burial, Wilkins sees Kreeg screaming from his window, begging for help; Wilkins disregards this and Kreeg is knocked down by an unknown assailant. Later, Wilkins arrives in his basement, where he helps his son Billy carve a jack-o\'-lantern in their basement, which is revealed to be Charlie\'s severed head. The sequence ends with Billy saying But don\'t forget to help me with the eyes.The School Bus Massacre Revisited.Four kidsMacy (Britt McKillip), Schrader (Jean-Luc Bilodeau), Sara (Isabelle Deluce), and Chip (Alberto Ghisi), the same trick-or-treaters who earlier visited Wilkinsmeet up with Rhonda (Samm Todd), a savant, and journey to the local rock quarry where Macy tells them the local urban legend of The Halloween School Bus Massacre. Thirty years ago, in 1977, there was a group of mentally challenged kids. Their parents were embarrassed by their conditions and saw them to be a burden to them, and as such, they were sent off to a school in another town so they would not face the townspeople\'s mocking. One day, on Halloween, they paid the bus driver to kill the kids so they would be freed of their burden. He drove the bus to the quarry, chained the kids to the seats, and while he was checking them, one kid managed to get free and went to the steering wheel, wanting to drive back home; however, he set the gear in forward instead of reverse and drove into the lake, drowning them all. However, the bus driver managed to get out alive & was never heard from again. Some say the school bus sank so deep it couldn\'t be found. Others say the town didn\'t want the school bus to be found.The group plays a prank on Rhonda in which they pretend to be the undead children, and chase Rhonda until she trips and knocks herself out. Macy kicks a jack-o\'-lantern into the lake, whereafter the school bus children suddenly rise from the water. The undead children chase the group and manage to grab hold of the chains which Sara is wearing as part of her costume, dragging her away to be killed. Meanwhile, Rhonda has locked herself in the elevator leading out of the quarry. Despite the others begging her to open it, she ignores them and rides it up herself as the School Bus children corner them as a revenge for the prank. As Rhonda steps out of the elevator, the other kids are heard being dismembered and eaten alive. As Rhonda begins walking home, the small boy in the orange footed pajamas and burlap sack looks on at a distance.Surprise Party.Laurie (Anna Paquin), a self-conscious 22-year-old virgin, is getting ready for a party with her older sister Danielle (Lauren Lee Smith) and their two friends Maria (Rochelle Aytes) and Janet (Moneca Delain). Annoyed by their talk about boys, she stays behind and plans to join them later. The other girls find local men to bring along with them. Later, alone on her way to the party, Laurie is attacked by a vampire dressed in black. Meanwhile, Danielle, Maria, and Janet party at a bonfire with the men they brought, with Danielle worried about Laurie. The vampire\'s body suddenly drops from a tree onto the party and Laurie appears. The vampire is revealed to be Principal Wilkins in disguise wearing fake fangs. The girls at the party, along with Laurie, suddenly transform into werewolves, removing their skin. It is revealed that Laurie\'s virginity actually signifies that she has never killed anyone before. The girls then proceed to devour their dates along with Wilkins, while the same small boy in the orange footed pajamas and burlap sack looks on.Meet Sam.Kreeg, a Halloween-hating man, lives alone with his dog, Spite, as his only companion. Kreeg shows his disgust for Halloween by scaring away trick-or-treaters. While at his house, Kreeg is attacked by Sam (Quinn Lord), the same small boy in the orange footed pajamas who has watched over all of the events of the evening. During the struggle, Kreeg rips off the sack over Sam\'s head to reveal his head to be a cross between a jack-o-lantern and a human skull. Kreeg runs to his window calling for Mr. Wilkins to help him, but is tackled by Sam. Kreeg gains the upper hand when he manages to fire his shotgun at Sam, seemingly killing him, in the process shooting off one of Sam\'s hands. As Kreeg dials 9-1-1, Sam re-attaches his hand and rises. Sam then attacks him again, stabbing at him with a large pumpkin lollipop out of which he has taken a bite, rendering it sharp. Sam finds that the lollipop has lodged itself into a piece of chocolate from which Kreeg had earlier taken a bite. Sam takes the lollipop wedged into the chocolate and walks away, now satisfied that Kreeg has fulfilled a tradition of Halloween. Meanwhile, pictures burning slowly in a nearby fireplace show a class photo of the masked children from the School Bus Massacre and the bus driver, who is revealed to be Kreeg.Conclusion.Bandaged and bruised from his encounter with Sam, Kreeg answers his door to give candy to trick-or-treaters. While on his porch, he spots Sam walk over to Emma and Henry\'s house just after she blows out the jack-o\'-lantern, revealing himself as Emma\'s killer in order to punish her for not following Halloween\'s rules. A traumatized Rhonda walks across the street and is almost hit by the laughing, human-form werewolf girls in their car, on their way back from the surprise party. Billy is sitting on his porch handing out candy, unaware that his father is now dead. Kreeg then walks back inside when there is another knock at the door. He opens the door to find the kids from the School Bus Massacre standing there with their bags outstretched, saying, Trick \'r Treat, and, suddenly recognizing them, stares in shock. A series of comic strip panels shows Kreeg being murdered and dismembered by them.Season\'s Greetings.Season\'s Greetings is an animated short created by Trick \'r Treat writer and director Michael Dougherty in 1996 and was the precursor of the film. The movie featured Sam as a little boy dressed in orange footy pajamas with his burlap sack head covering, as he is being stalked by a stranger on Halloween night. The short was released as a DVD extra on the original release for Trick \'r Treat and was aired on FEARnet in October 2013 as part of a 24-hour Trick \'r Treat marathon on Halloween.Trick \'r Treat.Trick r\' Treat was filmed on location in Vancouver, British Columbia. Originally slated for an October 5, 2007 theatrical release, it was announced in September 2007 that the film had been pushed back. After many festival screenings, it was released on video in 2009.Theatrical screenings.The first public screening took place at Harry Knowles\' Butt-Numb-A-Thon film festival in Austin, Texas, on December 9, 2007. Subsequent screenings included the Sitges Film Festival on October 7, 2008, the 2008 Screamfest Horror Film Festival on October 10, 2008, a free screening in New York sponsored by Fangoria on October 13, 2008, and another free screening in Los Angeles co-sponsored by Ain\'t It Cool News and Legendary Pictures on October 23, 2008. The film was also screened at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, the Fantasia Festival on July 29 and 30, 2009, the film festival Terror in the Aisles 2 in Chicago on August 15, 2009, and the After Dark film festival in Toronto on August 20, 2009 at The Bloor.Home media.Warner Bros. Pictures and Legendary Pictures released the film direct to DVD and Blu-ray on October 6, 2009 in North America, October 26 in the UK, and October 28 in Australia.Comic books.DC Comics partner Wildstorm Comics had planned to release a four-issue adaptation of Trick \'r Treat written by Marc Andreyko and illustrated by Fiona Staples, with covers by Michael Dougherty, Breehn Burns and Ragnar. The series was originally going to be released weekly in October 2007, ending on Halloween, but the series was pushed back due to the film\'s backlisting. The four comics were instead released as a graphic novel adaptation in October 2009. Legendary Comics set the second Trick \'r Treat comic book, titled \', for an October 2015 release date, and features Arts of Artist Fiona Staples. The comic will be released alongside the graphic novel adaptation of Dougherty\'s Krampus.Critical reaction.Despite only a handful of public screenings, the film has received critical acclaim. Based on 21 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an overall Fresh approval rating from critics of 86%, with an average score of 7.4/10 and a critical consensus that the deftly crafted tribute to Halloween legends, Trick \'r\' Treat hits all the genre marks with gusto and old fashioned suspense. Dread Central gave it 5 out of 5 stars, stating, Trick \'r Treat ranks alongside John Carpenter\'s Halloween as traditional October viewing and I can\'t imagine a single horror fan that won\'t fall head over heels in love with it. The film earned 10 out of 10 from Ryan Rotten of ShockTilYouDrop.com. IGN called it a very well-crafted Halloween horror tribute and a scary blast, rating it a score of 8 out of 10. Bloody Disgusting ranked the film ninth in their list of the \'Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade\', calling it so good that its lack of a theatrical release borders on the criminal.Sequel.Michael Dougherty announced in October 2009 that he is planning a sequel, but later stated that there were no active development nor an attempt at a pitch. He went on to say that [the] more fans continue to support and spread the movie, the more likely it is that Sam will rise from the pumpkin patch once more. Dougherty helped create a short promotional Easter trailer for FEARnet\'s Trick \'r Treat 24-hour marathon for Halloween 2011; the trailer showed a family\'s Easter celebration turning into one of horror, with Sam watching the chaos outside whilst wearing rabbit ears. In October 2013, Dougherty and Legendary Pictures officially announced a sequel, titled Trick \'r Treat 2. Dougherty said he plans to shake it up a little bit with the sequel.'),(2319776,'Lunar_effect','Lunar effect.The term lunar effect refers to the belief that there is correlation between specific stages of the Earth\'s lunar cycle and behavior in animals (including humans), that cannot simply be explained by variation in light levels. A considerable number of studies have examined the belief: by the late 1980s, there were at least 40 published studies on the purported lunar-lunacy connection, and at least 20 published studies on the purported lunar-birthrate connection. Several extensive literature reviews and meta-analyses have found no correlation between the lunar cycle and human biology or behavior. One study with incomplete control for age and sex of a small sample indicates a possible connection between sleep quality and lunar phases, but a subsequent analysis conducted with a larger sample size and better experimental controls did not replicate the findings. The Moon, however, does influence the behavior of several animals.Origins of the belief.Examples of the belief have been found in ancient Assyrian/Babylonian writing. The term lunatic itself was derived in Latin from the word luna, meaning moon.Fertility.It is widely believed that the Moon has a relationship with fertility due to the corresponding human menstrual cycle, which averages 28 days. However, no connection between lunar rhythms and menstrual onset has been conclusively shown to exist, and the similarity in length between the two cycles is most likely coincidental.Reproductive behavior.California Grunion fish have an unusual mating and spawning ritual during the spring and summer months. The egg laying takes place on four consecutive nights, beginning on the nights of the full and new Moons, when tides are highest. However, this is a well understood reproductive strategy that is more related to tides than it is to lunar phase. It happens to correlate with the lunar phase because tides are highest when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are aligned, i.e., at new Moon or full Moon.Birth rate.Three studies carried out between 1959 and 1973 reported a 1 percent increase in births in New York following a full Moon. However, multiple studies have found no connection between birth rate and lunar phases. A 1957 analysis of 9,551 births in Danville, PA, found no correlation between birth rate and the phase of the Moon. Records of 11,961 live births and 8,142 natural births (not induced by drugs or cesarean section) over a 4-year period (1974-1978) at the UCLA hospital did not correlate in any way with the cycle of lunar phases. Analysis of 3,706 spontaneous births (excluding births resulting from induced labor) in 1994 showed no correlation with lunar phase. The distribution of 167,956 spontaneous vaginal deliveries, at 37 to 40 weeks gestation, in Phoenix, AZ, between 1995 and 2000, showed no relationship with lunar phase. Analysis of 564,039 births (1997 to 2001) in North Carolina showed no predictable influence of the lunar cycle on deliveries or complications. Analysis of 6,725 deliveries (2000 to 2006) in Hannover revealed no significant correlation of birth rate to lunar phases. A 2001 analysis of 70,000,000 birth records from the National Center for Health Statistics revealed no correlation between birth rate and lunar phase. An extensive review of 21 studies from 7 different countries showed that the majority of studies reported no relationship to lunar phase, and that the positive studies were inconsistent with each other. A review of 6 additional studies from 5 different countries similarly showed no evidence of relationship between birth rate and lunar phase.Blood loss.It is sometimes claimed that surgeons used to refuse to operate on the full Moon because of the increased risk of death of the patient through blood loss. One study, in Barcelona, Spain, found a statistically significant correlation between lunar phase and hospital admissions due to gastrointestinal bleeding, but only when comparing full Moon days to all non-full Moon days lumped together. The statistical significance of the results disappears if one compares day 29 of the lunar cycle (full Moon) to days 9, 12, 13, or 27 of the lunar cycle, which have an almost equal number of hospital admissions. Researchers acknowledged that the wide variation in the number of admissions throughout the lunar cycle limited the interpretation of the results.In October 2009, British politician David Tredinnick asserted that during a full Moon [s]urgeons will not operate because blood clotting is not effective and the police have to put more people on the street.. A spokesman for the Royal College of Surgeons said they would laugh their heads off at the suggestion they could not operate at the full Moon.Human behavior.Two studies found evidence that those with mental disorders i.e Schizophrenia generally exhibit 1.8% of increased violent or aggressive episodes during the full Moon, but a more recent study found no such correlation to that of nonschizophrenic human beings. An analysis of mental-health data found a significant effect of Moon phases, but only on schizophrenic patients. Such effects are not necessarily related directly to the appearance of the Moon. A study into epilepsy found a significant negative correlation between the mean number of seizures and the phase of the Moon, but this correlation disappeared when the local clarity of the night sky was controlled for, suggesting that it was the brightness of the night that influenced the occurrence of epileptic seizures with advanced photosensitive epilepsy.A 1978 review of the literature found that lunar phases and human behavior are not related.Law and order.Senior police officers in Brighton, UK announced in June 2007 that they were planning to deploy more officers over the summer to counter trouble they believe is linked to the lunar cycle. This followed research by the Sussex Police force that concluded there was a rise in violent crime when the Moon was full. A spokeswoman for the police force said research carried out by us has shown a correlation between violent incidents and full moons. A police officer responsible for the research told the BBC that From my experience of 19 years of being a police officer, undoubtedly on full moons we do seem to get people with sort of strange behavior - more fractious, argumentative.Police in Ohio and Kentucky have blamed temporary rises in crime on the full Moon. In January 2008, New Zealand\'s Justice Minister Annette King suggested that a spate of stabbings in the country could have been caused by the lunar cycle.A reported correlation between Moon phase and the number of homicides in Dade County was found, through later analysis, not to be supported by the data and to have been the result of inappropriate and misleading statistical procedures.Politics.It was suggested, by Guy Cramer, president of the aerospace science company United Dynamics Corp, that the full Moon might have influenced voter behavior in the US 2000 Presidential Election.Sleep quality.A July 2013 study carried out at the University of Basel in Switzerland suggests a correlation between the full Moon and human sleep quality. Professor Cajochen and colleagues presented evidence that a lunar rhythm can modulate sleep structure in humans when measured under the highly controlled conditions of a circadian laboratory study protocol without time cues. Studying 33 volunteer subjects, the researchers found that subjective and objective measures of sleep varied according to lunar phase and thus may reflect human circalunar rhythmicity. Stringently controlled laboratory conditions, in a cross-sectional setting, were employed to exclude confounding effects such as increased light at night or the potential bias in perception. Measures of lunar influence on sleep structure, electroencephalographic activity during non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM), and secretion of the hormones melatonin and cortisol, were retrospectively analyzed. At no point, during and after the study, were volunteers or investigators aware of the posteriori analysis relative to lunar phase. Around full Moon it was found that electroencephalogram (EEG) delta activity during NREM sleep, an indicator of deep sleep, decreased by 30%, time to fall asleep increased by five minutes, and EEG-assessed total sleep duration was reduced by 20 minutes. These changes were associated with a decrease in subjective sleep quality and diminished endogenous melatonin levels. Cajochen said: The lunar cycle seems to influence human sleep, even when one does not \'see\' the Moon and is not aware of the actual Moon phase.There are suggestions that the 2013 Cajochen study is faulty because of a relatively small sample size and inappropriate controls for gender and sex. A 2014 study with a larger sample size and better experimental controls found no effect of the lunar phase on sleep quality metrics.Meta-analyses.A meta-analysis of thirty-seven studies that examined relationships between the Moon\'s four phases and human behavior revealed no significant correlation. The authors found that, of twenty-three studies that had claimed to show correlation, nearly half contained at least one statistical error. Similarly, in a review of twenty studies examining correlations between Moon phase and suicides, most of the twenty studies found no correlation, and the ones that did report positive results were inconsistent with each other.In animals.Correlation between hormonal changes in the testis and lunar periodicity was found in streamlined spinefoot, which spawns synchronously around the last Moon quarter. In orange-spotted spinefoot, lunar phases affect the levels of melatonin in the blood.In insects, the lunar cycle may affect hormonal changes early in phylogenesis. The body weight of honeybees peaks during new Moon. Spawning of coral Platygyra lamellina occurs at night during the summer on a date determined by the phase of the Moon; in the Red Sea, this is the three to five day period around the new Moon in July and the similar period in August. Evidence for lunar effect in reptiles, birds and mammals is either lacking or scant.Proposed explanations.Believers in the lunar theory suggest several different mechanisms by which the behaviour of the Moon could influence the behaviour of human beings. A common suggestion is that, since the Moon affects large bodies of water such as the ocean (a phenomenon known as tidal force), the Moon should be expected to have an analogous effect on human beings, whose bodies contain a great deal of water. However, this is a misconception that fails to take into account differences in scale. The tidal force is in fact very weak and should be expected to exercise no more gravitational pull on the human body than a mosquito. Besides this, the suggestion failed to account for the dependence of tides from both the phase of the Moon and the time of day. A further suggestion is that positive ions increase in abundance during a full Moon and that this should be expected to influence human behavior. However, this is a pseudo-scientific claim. Not only is the increase in frequency extremely slight (much smaller than that caused by air conditioning and air pollution), but ionic chargepositive or negativehas no effect on human behavior, and no physiological effect other than static electric shock.Believers (David Tredinnick being a prominent example) often support their claims by noting that many police officers, teachers, and nurses have observed a lunar effect in the course of their work. To the extent that nurses and police officers do indeed claim to observe patterns, this is most likely to be explained in terms of confirmation bias: People notice if something dramatic happens during a full Moon, but do not notice when nothing dramatic happens; furthermore, dramatic occurrences that do not occur during full Moons are typically not counted as evidence against the belief. Believers are further bolstered in their belief through communal reinforcement: The more people talk about the effect, the more people notice spurious relationships.Possible evolutionary explanations.For some 34 million years, bipedal hominins in the East African Rift valley were evolving in potential conflict and competition with fearsome carnivores including sabre-toothed cats equipped with excellent night-vision. Using the largest data set ever recorded  1,000 lion attacks on humans across Tanzania between 1988 and 2009  Craig Packer and his colleagues showed that there is a peak of attacks by lions upon humans during the evening dark hours following full Moon. According to Packer, this may help explain why so many myths and superstitions attribute fearsome dangers and nightmarish potencies to the Moon. While not all archaeologists accept that lunar periodicity was ever relevant to human evolution, those favouring the idea include Curtis Marean, who heads excavations at the important Middle Stone Age site of Pinnacle Point, South Africa. Marean argues that anatomically modern humans around 165,000 years ago  when inland regions of the continent were dry, arid and uninhabitable  became restricted to small populations clustered around coastal refugia, reliant on marine resources including shellfish whose safe harvesting at spring low tides presupposed careful tracking of lunar phase. Against this background, if Marean is right, humans who ignored or misread the Moon might frequently have been drowned.'),(37725601,'Inder_Verma','Inder Verma.Inder Mohan Verma (born November 28, 1947) is an American Cancer Society Professor of Molecular Biology in the Laboratory of Genetics at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies and the University of California, San Diego.

We are more interested in building a platform that is sourceable worldwide. We want a platform that is safe, simple to build, reproduce, duplicate and understand. We want you to truly own it, and have access to all the designs that went into it. and We also are writing open source software and plug-ins from the ground up which will do things you have never seen before (open source software or not).Hardware specifications.The Lasersaur is simple to build, using only basic tools (a hand drill, metric hex key set, screwdriver, wire cutter and soldering iron). Construction time varies between a few days to a few months. The unit will cut any dense organic material such as plywood and cloth as well as some plastics such as acrylic glass up to thick (depending on the power of the laser tube selected) with up to 100m of accuracy.Mechanics.The Lasersaur mechanics comprise both stationary and dynamic parts. The primary building blocks of both the frame and the gantry are T-slot aluminum extrusions bolted together with M5 bolts and T-slot nuts. This approach to machine construction is widely used in the automation industry and many suppliers offer compatible parts. The Lasersaur is designed around extrusions with 20, 40 and 80mm side lengths. All of the mount assemblies are built from angle brackets.A few parts are custom-cut 6mm acrylic (or more recently, aluminium) pieces. CAD drawings for the acrylic parts are freely available and can be made using a laser cutter - and should they fail, they may be replaced with spare parts made by the lasersaur itself. Aluminum versions of those parts may be purchased from Nortd labs and are advised for heavy-use machines due to cracking issues with the acrylic parts.The linear motion assemblies for the x- and y-axis roll directly on anodized aluminum extrusions. No proprietary rails and carriage assemblies are used. The Lasersaur carriages are built from standard-sized ball bearings (with nylon coating), cap screws and custom-cut acrylic or metal pieces. Both axes are minimally constrained.The v13 (and earlier) Lasersaurs use 12-tooth pulleys, 5.08mm XL belts and 2,000 micro-steps steppers/drivers. This results in a resolution of 0.03mm/step. The newer v14 (and later) designs used geared-down stepper motors that produce a theoretical resolution of 0.01mm - although in practice, slop in the belts and vibrations in the machine make this number unachievable. With a 100 watt laser tube, kerf widths down a low as 0.03mm are possible.The outer skin of the machine is made from powder-coated sheet steel with polycarbonate panels for the door/lid assembly.A bay spanning the width of the machine at the rear contains the laser tube and all of the electronics.The machine has no hardware control panel, the only physical control is the emergency stop button. All other operations are controlled via a web page that\'s served by the on-board BeagleBone Black control computer, running the Ubuntu linux operating system.Electronics.In versions of the Lasersaur up to and including v12.08, the hardware is controlled by an Arduino Uno embedded computer with a custom LasaurShield card to interface to switches, motors and laser power supply. Two GeckoDrive modules are used for stepper motor control and a power relay controls 110/220V power to the laser power supply. An external computer commands the Arduino via a standard USB interface.In v12.11 and later, a custom board called DriveBoard contains an ATmega328 SoC computer (replacing the Arduino) and all of the drive electronics with the exception of the two GeckoDrive modules and a BeagleBone embedded Linux computer which are attached to it. Interfacing is via an Ethernet cable. There is also experimental support for replacing the BeagleBone with a Raspberry Pi computer and using Nanotec SMC11 stepper motor controllers instead of the GeckoDrive units.Both LasaurShield and DriveBoard can be purchased from Nortd Labs, but schematics and board layout are publicly available from http://www.lasersaur.com/manual/model.Software.From an end-user perspective, the web-based interface allows for uploading of SVG files to the Lasersaur and control of feed-rates and laser power for cutting and/or etching of the material depending on the colors used to draw the various lines and curves in the SVG file. Conventionally, red lines are used for cutting and blue or black for etching - but the software supports arbitrary choices in this regard. There is also rudimentary support for loading raw G-code and DXF files.The front end web interface is served up by the LasaurApp code using the.

It took place in either 469 or 466 BC, in the vicinity of the mouth of the Eurymedon River (now the Kpray) in Pamphylia, Asia Minor. It forms part of the Wars of the Delian League, itself part of the larger Greco-Persian Wars.The Delian League had been formed between Athens and many of the city-states of the Aegean to continue the war with Persia, which had begun with the first and second Persian invasions of Greece (492490 and 480479 BC, respectively). In the aftermath of the Battles of Plataea and Mycale, which had ended the second invasion, the Greek Allies had taken the offensive, besieging the cities of Sestos and Byzantium. The Delian League then took over responsibility for the war, and continued to attack Persian bases in the Aegean throughout the next decade.In either 469 or 466 BC, the Persians began assembling a large army and navy for a major offensive against the Greeks. Gathering near the Eurymedon, it is possible that the expedition aimed to move up the coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city in turn. This would bring the Asiatic Greek regions back under Persian control, and give the Persians naval bases from which to launch further expeditions into the Aegean. Hearing of the Persian preparations, the Athenian general Cimon took 200 triremes and sailed to Phaselis in Pamphylia, which eventually agreed to join the Delian League. This effectively blocked the Persian strategy at its first objective.Cimon then moved to pre-emptively attack the Persian forces near the Eurymedon. Sailing into the mouth of the river, Cimon quickly routed the Persian fleet gathered there. Most of the Persian fleet made land-fall, and the sailors fled to the shelter of the Persian army. Cimon then landed the Greek marines and proceeded to attack the Persian army, which was also routed. The Greeks captured the Persian camp, taking many prisoners, and were able to destroy 200 beached Persian triremes. This stunning double victory seems to have greatly demoralised the Persians, and prevented any further Persian campaigning in the Aegean until at least 451 BC. However, the Delian League do not appear to have pressed home their advantage, probably because of other events in the Greek world that required their attention.Sources & Chronology.Unfortunately, the military history of Greece between the end of the second Persian invasion of Greece and the Peloponnesian War (479431 BC) is poorly attested by surviving ancient sources. This period, sometimes referred to as the pentekontaetia by ancient scholars, was a period of relative peace and prosperity within Greece. The richest source for the period, and also the most contemporary with it, is Thucydides\'s History of the Peloponnesian War, which is generally considered by modern historians to be a reliable primary account. Thucydides only mentions this period in a digression on the growth of Athenian power in the run up to the Peloponnesian War, and the account is brief, probably selective and lacks any dates. Nevertheless, Thucydides\'s account can be, and is used by historians to draw up a skeleton chronology for the period, on to which details from archaeological records and other writers can be superimposed.Much extra detail for the period is provided by Plutarch, in his biographies of Aristides and especially Cimon. Plutarch was writing some 600 years after the events in question, and is therefore very much a secondary source, but he often explicitly names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of his statements. In his biographies, he explicitly draws on many ancient histories that have not survived, and thus often preserves details of the period that Thucydides\'s brief account omits. The final major extant source for the period is the universal history (Bibliotheca historica) of the 1st century BC Sicilian, Diodorus Siculus. Much of Diodorus\'s writing concerning this period seems to be derived from the much earlier Greek historian Ephorus, who also wrote a universal history. However, from what little we know of Ephorus, historians are generally disparaging towards his history. Diodorus, who has often been dismissed by modern historians, is therefore not a particularly good source for this period. Indeed, one of his translators, Oldfather, says of Diodorus\'s account of the Eurymedon campaign that ...the three preceding chapters reveal Diodorus in the worst light.... There is also a reasonable body of archaeological evidence for the period, of which inscriptions detailing probable tribute lists of the Delian League are particularly important.Chronology.Thucydides provides a succinct list of the main events occurring between the end of the second Persian invasion and the outbreak of the Peloponnesian War, but almost no chronological information. Various attempts have been made to reassemble the chronology, but there is no definitive answer. The assumption central to these attempts is that Thucydides is describing the events in the appropriate chronological order. The one firmly accepted date is 465 BC for the beginning of the Siege of Thasos. This is based on an ancient scholiast\'s annotation of a copy of Aeschines\'s works. The scholiast notes that the Athenians met disaster at the \'Nine-Ways\' in the archonship of Lysitheus (known to be 465/464 BC). Thucydides mentions this attack on the \'Nine-Ways\' in connection with the beginning of the Siege of Thasos, and since Thucydides says that the siege ended in its third year, the Siege of Thasos therefore dates to c.465463 BC.The Battle of Eurymedon has been dated to 469 BC by Plutarch\'s anecdote about the Archon Apsephion (469/468 BC) choosing Cimon and his fellow generals as judges in a competition. The implication is that Cimon had recently achieved a great victory, and the most likely candidate is Eurymedon. However, since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred after the Athenian siege of Naxos (but before the Siege of Thasos), the date of Eurymedon is clearly constrained by the date of Naxos. Whilst some accept a date of 469 or earlier for this Naxos, another school of thought places it as late as 467 BC. Since the Battle of Eurymedon seems to have occurred before Thasos, the alternative date for this battle would therefore be 466 BC. Modern historians are split, some supporting 469 BC as the most likely date, and others opting for 466 BC.Background.The Greco-Persian Wars had their roots in the conquest of the Greek cities of Asia Minor, and in particular Ionia, by the Persian Empire of Cyrus the Great shortly after 550 BC. The Persians found the Ionians difficult to rule, eventually settling for sponsoring a tyrant in each Ionian city. While Greek states had in the past often been ruled by tyrants, this was a form of government on the decline. By 500 BC, Ionia appears to have been ripe for rebellion against these Persian place-men. The simmering tension finally broke into open revolt due to the actions of the tyrant of Miletus, Aristagoras. Attempting to save himself after a disastrous Persian-sponsored expedition in 499 BC, Aristagoras chose to declare Miletus a democracy. This triggered similar revolutions across Ionia, and indeed Doris and Aeolis, beginning the Ionian Revolt.The Greek states of Athens and Eretria allowed themselves to be drawn into this conflict by Aristagoras, and during their only campaigning season (498 BC) they contributed to the capture and burning of the Persian regional capital of Sardis. After this, the Ionian Revolt carried on (without further outside aid) for a further 5 years, until it was finally completely crushed by the Persians. However, in a decision of great historic significance, the Persian king Darius the Great decided that, despite successfully subduing the revolt, there remained the unfinished business of exacting punishment on Athens and Eretria for supporting the revolt. The Ionian Revolt had severely threatened the stability of Darius\'s empire, and the states of mainland Greece would continue to threaten that stability unless dealt with. Darius thus began to contemplate the complete conquest of Greece, beginning with the destruction of Athens and Eretria.In the next two decades there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, including some of the most famous battles in history. During the first invasion, Thrace, Macedon and the Aegean islands were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed. However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes then led the second invasion personally in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece. Those Greeks who chose to resist (the \'Allies\') were defeated in the twin battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium on land and at sea respectively. All of Greece except the Peloponnesus thus fell into Persian hands, but then seeking to finally destroy the Allied navy, the Persians suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian invasion force at the Battle of Plataea, ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.According to tradition, on the same day as Plataea, the Allied fleet defeated the demoralised remnants of the Persian fleet in the Battle of Mycale. This action marks the end of the Persian invasion, and the beginning of the next phase in the Greco-Persian wars, the Greek counterattack. After Mycale, the Greek cities of Asia Minor again revolted, with the Persians now powerless to stop them. The Allied fleet then sailed to the Chersonesos, still held by the Persians, and besieged and captured the town of Sestos. The following year, 478 BC, the Allies sent a force to capture the city of Byzantium (modern day Istanbul). The siege was successful, but the behaviour of the Spartan general Pausanias alienated many of the Allies, and resulted in Pausanias\'s recall. The siege of Byzantium was the last action of the Hellenic alliance that defeated the Persian invasion.After Byzantium, Sparta was eager to end her involvement in the war. The Spartans were of the view that, with the liberation of mainland Greece, and the Greek cities of Asia Minor, the war\'s purpose had already been reached. There was also perhaps a feeling that securing long-term security for the Asian Greeks would prove impossible. The loose alliance of city states that fought against Xerxes\'s invasion was dominated by Sparta and the Peloponnesian league. With the Spartan withdrawal, the leadership of the Greeks now explicitly passed to the Athenians. A congress was called on the holy island of Delos to institute a new alliance to continue the fight against the Persians. This alliance, now including many of the Aegean islands, was formally constituted as the \'First Athenian Alliance\', commonly known as the Delian League. According to Thucydides, the official aim of the League was to avenge the wrongs they suffered by ravaging the territory of the king. Forces of the Delian League spent much of the next decade expelling the remaining Persian garrisons from Thrace, and expanding the Aegean territory controlled by the League.Prelude.Once the Persian forces in Europe had largely been neutralised, the Athenians seem to have gone about starting to extend the League in Asia Minor. The islands of Samos, Chios and Lesbos seem to have become members of the original Hellenic alliance after Mycale, and presumably were also therefore original members of the Delian League. However, it is unclear exactly when the other Ionian cities, or indeed the other Greek cities of Asia Minor, joined the league, though they certainly did at some point. Thucydides attests the presence of Ionians at Byzantium in 478 BC, so it is possible that at least some of the Ionian cities joined the league in early 478 BC. The Athenian politician Aristides was said to have died in Pontus (c. 468 BC) whilst on public business. Given that Aristides was responsible for organising the financial contributions of each League member, this trip may have been connected with expansion of the League into Asia Minor.Cimon\'s Eurymedon campaign itself seems to have begun in response to the assembly of a large Persian fleet and army at Aspendos, near the mouth of the Eurymedon River. It is usually argued that the Persians were the would-be aggressors, and that Cimon\'s campaign was launched to deal with this new threat. Cawkwell suggests that the Persian build-up was the first concerted attempt to counter the activity of the Greeks since the failure of the second invasion. It is possible that internal strife within the Persian empire had contributed to the length of time it took to launch this campaign. Cawkwell outlines the Persian strategic problems: Persia was a land power which used its naval forces in close conjunction with its armies, not free ranging in enemy waters. In any case, secure naval bases were necessary. In the Ionian Revolt with land forces already operating in Ionia and elsewhere along the Aegean seaboard, it was easy for a Royal army and navy to deal with the revolt, but in view of the general revolt of the [Ionian] cities in 479 BC and the subsequent successes of the Greek navies the only way for Persia must have seemed to be to move along the coast restoring order in city after city, with fleet and army moving together. The nature of naval warfare in the Ancient world, dependent as it was on large teams of rowers, meant that ships would have to make landfall every few days to resupply with food and water. This severely limited the range of an Ancient fleet, and essentially meant that navies could only operate in the vicinity of secure naval bases. Cawkwell therefore suggests that the Persian forces gathered at Aspendos were aiming to move along the southern coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city, until eventually the Persian navy could begin operating in Ionia again. Alexander the Great would employ this strategy in reverse in winter of 333 BC. Lacking a navy with which to take on the Persians, Alexander settled instead for denying the Persian navy suitable bases, by capturing the ports of southern Asia Minor.Plutarch says that upon hearing that the Persian forces were gathering at Aspendos, Cimon sailed from Cnidus (in Caria) with 200 triremes. It is highly likely that Cimon had assembled this force because the Athenians had had some warning of a forthcoming Persian campaign to re-subjugate the Asiatic Greeks. Certainly, no other league business would have required such a great force. Cimon may have been waiting in Caria because he expected the Persians to march straight into Ionia, along the Royal road from Sardis. According to Plutarch, Cimon sailed with these 200 triremes to the Greek city of Phaselis (in Lycia) but was refused admittance. He therefore began ravaging the lands of Phaselis, but with the mediation of the Chian contingent of his fleet, the people of Phaselis agreed to join the league. They were to contribute troops to the expedition, and to pay the Athenians ten talents. The fact that Cimon pre-emptively sailed to and captured Phaselis suggests that he anticipated a Persian campaign to capture the coastal cities (as outlined above). The presence of both army and navy at Aspendos may have persuaded him that there was to be no immediate assault on Ionia. By capturing Phaselis, the furthest east Greek city in Asia Minor (and just to the west of the Eurymedon), he effectively blocked the Persian campaign before it had begun, denying them the first naval base they needed to control. Taking further initiative, Cimon then moved to directly attack the Persian fleet at Aspendos.Greek.According to Plutarch, the League fleet consisted of 200 triremes. These were of the sleek Athenian aphract (deckless) design, originally developed by Themistocles primarily for ramming actions, although they had been modified by Cimon to improve their suitability for boarding actions.The standard complement of a trireme was 200 men, including 14 marines. In the second Persian invasion of Greece, each Persian ship had carried thirty extra marines, and this was probably also true in the first invasion when the whole invasion force was apparently carried in triremes. Furthermore, the Chian ships at the Battle of Lade also carried 40 marines each. This suggests that a trireme could probably carry a maximum of 4045 soldierstriremes seem to have been easily destabilised by extra weight. There were therefore probably around 5,000 hoplite marines with the League fleet.Persian.Several different estimates for the size of the Persian fleet are given. Thucydides says that there was a fleet of 200 Phoenician ships, and is generally considered the most reliable source. Plutarch gives numbers of 350 from Ephorus and 600 from Phanodemus. Furthermore, Plutarch says that the Persian fleet was awaiting 80 Phoenician ships sailing from Cyprus. Although Thucydides\'s account is generally to be favoured, there may an element of truth in Plutarch\'s assertion that the Persians were awaiting further reinforcements; this would explain why Cimon was able to launch a pre-emptive assault on them. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for the size of the Persian land army. However, the number of Persian marines accompanying the fleet was presumably in the same range as the number of Greek marines (c. 5,000), since the Persian ships carried the same complement of troops. Plutarch quotes Ephorus as saying that Tithraustes was commander of the royal fleet, and Pherendatis of the infantry, but says that Callisthenes named Ariomandes as overall commander.Battle.Thucydides gives only the barest of details for this battle; the most reliable detailed account is given by Plutarch. According to Plutarch, the Persian fleet was anchored off the mouth of the Eurymedon, awaiting the arrival of 80 Phoenician ships from Cyprus. Cimon, sailing from Phaselis, made to attack the Persians before the reinforcements arrived, whereupon the Persian fleet, eager to avoid fighting, retreated into the river itself. However, when Cimon continued to bear down on the Persians, they accepted battle. Regardless of their numbers, the Persian battle line was quickly breached, and the Persian ships then turned about, and made for the river bank. Grounding their ships, the crews sought sanctuary with the army waiting nearby. Some ships may have been captured or destroyed during the naval battle, but it seems likely that most were able to land.The Persian army now began to move towards the Greek fleet, which had presumably also grounded itself in order to capture the Persian ships. Despite the weariness of his troops after this first battle, Cimon, seeing that his men were exalted by the impetus and pride of their victory, and eager to come to close quarters with the Barbarians, landed the marines and proceeded to attack the Persian army. Initially the Persian line held the Athenian assault, but eventually, as at the Battle of Mycale, the heavily armoured hoplites proved superior, and routed the Persian army. Fleeing back to their camp, the Persians were then captured, along with their camp, by the victorious Greeks.Thucydides says that 200 Phoenician ships were captured and destroyed. It is highly unlikely that this occurred during the apparently brief naval battle, so these were probably grounded ships captured after the battle and destroyed with fire, as has been the case at Mycale. Plutarch says that 200 ships were captured, in addition to those that were destroyed or fled. It is possible that \'destroyed\' in this context means sunk during the battle, since the Greeks would almost certainly have destroyed the ships that they captured as well (as Thucydides indeed implies). Since Thucydides only explicitly gives the number of ships destroyed, it is possible to reconcile Plutarch\'s and Thucydides\'s numbers, but it is not clear that this is the best approach. There are no estimates in the ancient sources for casualties amongst the troops of either side.Plutarch says that, following his double victory, though like a powerful athlete he had brought down two contests in one day...Cimon still went on competing with his own victories. Cimon supposedly sailed with the Greek fleet as quickly as possible to intercept the fleet of 80 Phoenician ships the Persians had expected. Taking them by surprise, he captured or destroyed the entire fleet. However, Thucydides does not mention this subsidiary action, and some have cast doubt on whether it actually happened.Aftermath.According to Plutarch, one tradition had it that the Persian king (who at the time would still have been Xerxes) agreed a humiliating peace treaty in the aftermath of the Eurymedon. However, as Plutarch admits, other authors denied that such a peace was made at this time, and the more logical date for any peace treaty would have been after the Cyprus campaign of 450 BC. The alternative suggested by Plutarch is that the Persian king acted as if he had made a humiliating peace with the Greeks, because he was so fearful of engaging in battle with them again. It is generally considered unlikely by modern historians that a peace treaty was made in the aftermath of Eurymedon.The Eurymedon was a highly significant victory for the Delian League, which probably ended once and for all the threat of another Persian invasion of Greece. It also seems to have prevented any Persian attempt to reconquer the Asiatic Greeks until at least 451 BC. The accession of further cities of Asia Minor to the Delian league, particularly from Caria, probably followed Cimon\'s campaign there.Despite Cimon\'s massive victory, something of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks do not appear to have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next decade and a half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.'),(23840192,'Epirus_(ancient_state)','Epirus (ancient state).Epirus (; Northwest Greek:, peiros; Attic:, peiros) was an ancient Greek state, located in the geographical region of Epirus in the western Balkans. The homeland of the ancient Epirotes was bordered by the Aetolian League to the south, Thessaly and Macedonia to the east, and Illyrian tribes to the north. For a brief period (280275 BC), the Epirote leader Pyrrhus managed to make Epirus the most powerful state in the Greek world, and his armies marched against Rome during an unsuccessful campaign in Italy.Prehistory.Epirus has been occupied since at least Neolithic times by seafarers along the coast and by hunters and shepherds in the interior who brought with them the Greek language. These people buried their leaders in large tumuli containing shaft graves, similar to the Mycenaean tombs, indicating an ancestral link between Epirus and the Mycenaean civilization. A number of Mycenaean remains have been found in Epirus, especially at the most important ancient religious sites in the region, the Necromanteion (Oracle of the Dead) on the Acheron river, and the Oracle of Zeus at Dodona.The Dorians invaded Greece from Epirus and Macedonia at the end of the 2nd millennium BC (circa 11001000 BC), though the reasons for their migration are obscure. The region\'s original inhabitants were driven southward into the Greek mainland by the invasion and by the early 1st millennium BC three principal clusters of Greek-speaking tribes emerged in Epirus. These were the Chaonians of northwestern Epirus, the Molossians in the center, and the Thesprotians in the south.Molossian expansion (470330 BC).The Molossian Aeacidae dynasty managed to create the first centralized state in Epirus from about 370 BC onwards, expanding their power at the expense of rival tribes. The Aeacids allied themselves with the increasingly powerful kingdom of Macedon, in part against the common threat of Illyrian raids, and in 359 BC the Molossian princess Olympias, niece of Arybbas of Epirus, married King Philip II of Macedon (r. 359336 BC). She was to become the mother of Alexander the Great. On the death of Arybbas, Alexander the Molossian, uncle of Alexander the Great of Macedon, succeeded to the throne with the title King of Epirus.In 334 BC, the time Alexander the Great crossed into Asia, Alexander I the Molossian led an expedition in southern Italy in support of the Greek cities of Magna Graecia against the nearby Italian tribes and the emerging Roman Republic. After some successes on the battlefield, he was defeated by a coalition of Italic tribes at the Battle of Pandosia in 331 BC.Kingdom of Epirus (330231 BC).In 330 BC, upon Alexander the Molossian\'s death, the term Epirus appears as a single political unit in the ancient Greek records for the first time, under the leadership of the Molossian dynasty. Subsequently, the coinages of the three major Epirote tribal groups came to an end, and a new coinage was issued with the legend Epirotes. After Alexander\'s I death, Aeacides of Epirus, who succeeded him, espoused the cause of Olympias against Cassander, but was dethroned in 313 BC.Aeacides\'s son Pyrrhus came to the throne in 295 BC. Pyrrhus, being a skillful general, was encouraged to aid the Greeks of Tarentum and decided to initiate a major offensive in the Italian peninsula and Sicily. Due to its superior martial abilities, the Epirote army defeated the Romans in the Battle of Heraclea (280 BC). Subsequently, Pyrrhus\'s forces nearly reached the outskirts of Rome, but had to retreat to avoid an unequal conflict with a more numerous Roman army. The following year, Pyrrhus invaded Apulia (279 BC) and the two armies met in the Battle of Asculum where the Epirotes won the original Pyrrhic victory, at a high cost.In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured the Carthaginian fortress in Eryx, Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus. Meanwhile, he had begun to display despotic behavior towards the Sicilian Greeks and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Though he defeated the Carthaginians in battle, he was forced to abandon Sicily.Pyrrhus\'s Italian campaign came to an end following the inconclusive Battle of Beneventum (275 BC). Having lost the vast majority of his army, he decided to return to Epirus, which finally resulted in the loss of all his Italian holdings. Because of his costly victories, the term Pyrrhic victory is often used for a victory with devastating cost to the victor.Epirote League (231167 BC).In 233 BC, the last surviving member of the Aeacid royal house, Deidamia, was murdered. Her death brought the Epirote royal family to an abrupt extinction and a federal republic was set up, though with diminished territory, since western Acarnania had asserted its independence, and the Aetolians seized Ambracia, Amphilochia, and the remaining land north of the Ambracian Gulf. The new Epirote capital was therefore established at Phoenice, the political center of the Chaonians. The reasons for the swift fall of the Aeacid dynasty were probably complex. Aetolian pressure must have played a part, and the alliance with Macedonia may have been unpopular; in addition, there were perhaps social tensions. However, Epirus remained a substantial power, unified under the auspices of the Epirote League as a federal state with its own parliament (or synedrion).In the following years, Epirus faced the growing threat of the expansionist Roman Republic, which fought a series of wars with Macedonia. The League remained neutral in the first two Macedonian Wars but split in the Third Macedonian War (171168 BC), with the Molossians siding with the Macedonians and the Chaonians and Thesprotians siding with Rome. The outcome was disastrous for Epirus; Molossia fell to Rome in 167 BC and 150,000 of its inhabitants were enslaved.Organization.In antiquity, Epirus was settled by the same nomadic Hellenic tribes that went on to settle the rest of Greece. Unlike most other Greeks of the time, who lived in or around city-states such as Athens or Sparta, the Epirotes lived in small villages and their way of life was foreign to that of polis of southern Greeks. Their region lay on the edge of the Greek world and was far from peaceful; for many centuries, it remained a frontier area contested with the Illyrian peoples of the Adriatic coast and interior. However, Epirus had a far greater religious significance than might have been expected given its geographical remoteness, due to the presence of the shrine and oracle at Dodona  regarded as second only to the more famous oracle at Delphi.Culture.The Epirotes were speakers of an epichoric Northwest Greek dialect, different from the Dorian of the Greek colonies on the Ionian islands, and bearers of mostly Greek names, as evidenced by epigraphy. They seem to have been regarded with some disdain by some classical Greek writers. The 5th century BC Athenian historian Thucydides describes them as barbarians in his History of the Peloponnesian War, as does Strabo in his Geography. Other writers, such as Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Pausanias, and Eutropius, describe them as Greeks. Simon Hornblower interprets the vague, and sometimes even antithetical, comments of Thucydides on the Epirotes as implying that they were neither completely barbarian nor completely Greek, but akin to the latter. Nicholas Hammond opines that the principal social structure of the Epirotes was the tribe and that they spoke a West-Greek dialect.Plutarch mentions an interesting cultural element of the Epirotes regarding the Greek hero Achilles. In his biography of King Pyrrhus, he claims that Achilles had a divine status in Epirus and in the local dialect he was called Aspetos (meaning unspeakable, unspeakably great, in Homeric Greek).'),(10526146,'Simon_Str%C3%BCbin','Simon Strbin.Simon Strbin (born March 21, 1979 in Zurich) is a Swiss curler from Erlenbach.

To win All Four Cups in a single season was long regarded as the holy grail for a team. The feat was achieved on three occasions.Hunslet.The first club to win All Four Cups was Hunslet, which they did in the 190708 season. They were captained by Albert Goldthorpe, who operated in the back line. Hunslet\'s forward pack of that season was equally (in)famous, going by the name of The Terrible Six.Hunslet did not top the championship table at the end of the season, coming behind Oldham, whom they defeated, 1012, in a championship replay after the first match was drawn 7 apiece. They ran out 140 winners in the Challenge Cup Final in front of 18,000 spectators at Fartown, Huddersfield. They took the Yorkshire Cup by virtue of a 170 victory over Halifax.Huddersfield.The feat was next repeated by Huddersfield in the 191415 season by the Fartowners famous Team of all Talents. This was the culmination of a staggering period of dominance in the game, as they had already picked up two championships, the challenge cup, three Yorkshire Cups and three Yorkshire league titles in the preceding five seasons.They were captained by Harold Wagstaff, immortalised as the Prince of Centres, and included several foreign internationals. They easily defeated Leeds, 352, in the Championship final, and managed an even greater margin of victory in the Challenge Cup, crushing St Helens, 373, at Oldham.The season saw Huddersfield\'s wing-three-quarter Albert Rosenfeld score an impressive 56 tries. However this figure paled into insignificance when it is remembered that Rosenfeld, a Jewish Australian who had come over to Britain with the 1908 Kangaroos, had scored 80 tries the previous season. This record has never yet been beaten.The team of all the Talents could well have gone on to even greater exploits, however sadly the First World War intervened, and the team broke up. The Huddersfield club was unable to field a team, reforming only after the war ended.Swinton.The final team to win All Four Cups was Swinton, who thus became the only side ever to achieve a Lancashire version of the feat.

Sovrani left The Savoy to start Sovrani\'s Restaurant in Jermyn Street in 1927, taking Quaglino with him, however, according to rumour, Sovrani took too much interest in Quaglino\'s wife, causing him to resign as head waiter in 1929 and start Quaglino\'s in nearby Bury Street. Sovrani\'s lost a lot of business to Quaglino\'s and closed in 1931.

The defence argued that the words could not apply to Sovrani as his restaurant had already closed by the time they appeared and Quaglino\'s only brother was not married.

It is based on the ancient Chinese symbols of the Twelve Ornaments.History.The Empire of China during the Manchu-led Qing dynasty did not have an official state emblem, but the flag featured the azure dragon on a plain yellow field with a red sun of the three-legged crow in the upper left corner. It became the first national flag of China and is usually referred to as the Yellow Dragon Flag ().Following the end of Manchu rule, new national symbols were deemed necessary by the leaders to represent the changed circumstances. The renowned writers Lu Xun, Qian Daosun, and Xu Shoushang from the Ministry of Education were tasked with designing a new national emblem. It was presented on August 28, 1912 and was adopted as national emblem in February 1913. President-Emperor Yuan Shikai continued its use during his short imperial reign from 1915 to 1916.Coins issued during this time feature the emblem. A variation of the emblem was shown on orders and illustrations.The Northern Expedition led by General Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang party led to the overthrow of the fractious but legitimate Beiyang government in 1928. This ushered in a one-party state under the Kuomintang known as the Nanjing decade. The state emblem was therefore replaced with the Kuomintang party symbol Blue Sky with a White Sun.Design.The emblem is based on the ancient symbols of the Twelve Ornaments ().These are first mentioned as already ancient in the Book of Documents by Emperor Shun, who was one of the legendary Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Oral tradition holds that he lived sometime between 2294 and 2184 BCE.According to the book, the emperor wished for the symbols to be used on official robes of the state.The symbols were considered most auspicious and therefore as a set were reserved only for the emperor to be shown on his ceremonial robes.The national emblem arranges these symbols in such a way to reflect the order of achievement in western heraldry.Symbols.The dragon and phoenix represent the natural world. In yin and yang terminology, a dragon is male yang and the phoenix a female yin. Therefore, the emperor was often identified as the dragon, while the empress was the phoenix. The inclusion of the phoenix into the national symbol, opposite but equal to the dragon, can be seen as a symbol of women being equal to men, and a visual and poignant representation of women\'s rights in the new China.The mountains represent earth, the cups metal, the pondweed water, the rice grains wood, and fire, which are all representations of wu xing.'),(41299428,'Twenty-fourth_Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India','Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India.The Twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India, officially known as The Constitution (Twenty-fourth Amendment) Act, 1971, enables Parliament to dilute Fundamental Rights through Amendments of the Constitution. It also amended article 368 to provide expressly that Parliament has power to amend any provision of the Constitution. The amendment further made it obligatory for the President to give his assent, when a Constitution Amendment Bill was presented to him.The 24th Amendment was enacted, by the Congress government headed by Indira Gandhi, to abrogate the Supreme Court ruling in Golaknath v. State of Punjab. The judgment reversed the Supreme Court\'s earlier decision which had upheld Parliament\'s power to amend all parts of the Constitution, including Part III related to Fundamental Rights. The judgement left Parliament with no power to curtail Fundamental Rights. To abrogate the ruling, the government intended to amend article 368 to provide expressly that Parliament has power to amend any provision of the Constitution, thereby bringing Fundamental Rights within the scope of its amending procedure, and preventing review of those changes by the courts.The 24th Amendment came into force on 5 November 1971. The Indian press characterised the 24th Amendment as being too sweeping in its ambit, and of dubious legality. The Amendment was also opposed by jurists, and all surviving members of the Constituent Assembly at the time. The Supreme Court upheld the validity of the 24th Amendment in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala in 1971.Background.The 24th Amendment was effected to abrogate the Supreme Court ruling in Golaknath v. State of Punjab. The Supreme Court delivered its ruling, by a majority of 6-5 on 27 February 1967. The Court held that an amendment of the Constitution is a legislative process, and that an amendment under article 368 is law within the meaning of article 13 of the Constitution and therefore, if an amendment takes away or abridges a Fundamental Right conferred by Part III, it is void. Article 13(2) reads, The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the right conferred by this Part and any law made in contravention of this clause shall, to the extent of contravention, be void. The Court also ruled that Fundamental Rights included in Part III of the Constitution are given a transcendental position under the Constitution and are kept beyond the reach of Parliament. The Court also held that the scheme of the Constitution and the nature of the freedoms it granted incapacitated Parliament from modifying, restricting or impairing Fundamental Freedoms in Part III.The judgment reversed the Supreme Court\'s earlier decision which had upheld Parliament\'s power to amend all parts of the Constitution, including Part III related to Fundamental Rights. The judgement left Parliament with no power to curtail Fundamental Rights. To abrogate the ruling, the government intended to amend article 368 to provide expressly that Parliament has power to amend any provision of the Constitution, thereby bringing Fundamental Rights within the scope of its amending procedure.Proposal and enactment.The Bill was considered by the Lok Sabha on 3 and 4 August, and passed, in the original form, on 4 August 1971. While moving the bill for consideration in the Lok Sabha, Gokhale stated that the fear that Parliament would misuse the power to curtail Fundamental Rights once it acquired the power to amend them, was unfounded. Gokhale further stated that Directive Principles must prevail over Fundamental Rights, in case of conflict between the two.Union Education Minister Siddhartha Shankar Ray stated that allowing judgements like that in the Golaknath case would have disastrous consequences. Congress member Darbara Singh felt that the attitude of the Supreme Court must change with the times. A.K. Gopalan, leader of the Communist Party (Marxist) (CPM), supported the bill during the debate in the Lok Sabha on 3 August. Gopalan stated that the present Constitution was a bundle of contradictions drawn up by representatives of princely houses and big business.In response to critics of the amendment, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi stated, we are committed to the upholding of the fundamental freedom - of assembly and of worship - and our commitment to secular democracy is non-negotiable.The Bill, as passed by the Lok Sabha, was considered by the Rajya Sabha on 10 and 11 August and passed on 11 August 1971. The debate in the Rajya Sabha was brief.The bill received assent from then President Varahagiri Venkata Giri on 5 November 1971. It was notified in The Gazette of India and came into force on the same day.Reception.The Hindu, in its editorial on 6 August 1971, stated, All change and growth whether political or biological, have to conform to the basic laws of their province, or otherwise such growth would soon be found to be cancerous and self destructive. And even if certain urgently needed socio-economic changes call for a cribbling and cabining of the right property, the sweeping power conferred on Parliament by the 24th Amendment to tamper with all the rights, including the right to freedom of association and of religion, are such that it is not surprising that some leaders of minorities and some \'committed\' socialists have been alarmed over the grim possibilities. In a 1971 editorial on the amendment, The Statesman wrote, The implications are breath-taking. Parliament now has the power to deny the seven freedoms, abolish Constitutional remedies available to citizens, and to change the federal character of the Union.Legal expert V.G. Ramachandran, writing in the Supreme Court Cases Journal in 1971, stated that the 24th and 25th Amendments were not \'tinkering\' with the Constitution. It is a veritable slaughter of the Constitution. He felt that the 25th Amendment smacks of totalitarianism and hurry to achieve socialism instantly overnight.Mahommedali Currim Chagla, former Chief Justice of the Bombay High Court, opposed the 24th Amendment. Former Attorney-General M.C. Setalvad described the 24th Amendment as a complete negation of the rule of law, and stressed that apart from its effect on the Indian people, the amendment endangered government itself. Renowned jurists Kasturiranga Santhanam and Nanabhoy Palkhivala also opposed the amendment. The 24th Amendment was also opposed by B. Shiva Rao, Frank Anthony and all surviving members of the Constituent Assembly.The 24th Amendment received little attention from the general public at the time of its enactment, as their attention was focused on tense relations between India and Pakistan due to the ongoing Bangladesh Liberation War, which later led to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1971.Aftermath.The 24th Amendment was the first of a series of measures taken by Indira Gandhi to increase her power, and establish one-party rule. It was followed by several constitutional amendments designed to weaken the judiciary, and enhance the authority of Parliament and the Prime Minister\'s Office. The most notable among these were the 25th, 38th and 39th Amendments, culminating in the 42nd Amendment in 1976 during The Emergency, which brought about the most sweeping changes to the Constitution in history.Kesavananda Bharati case.The Supreme Court reviewed its decision in Golaknath v. State of Punjab, in 1971 in Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, and considered the validity of the 24th, 25th, 26th and 29th Amendments. The case was heard by the largest ever Constitutional Bench of 13 Judges. The Bench gave eleven judgements, which agreed on some points and differed on others. The Court held, by a margin of 7-6, that although no part of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights, was beyond the amending power of Parliament (thus overruling the 1967 case), the basic structure of the Constitution could not be abrogated even by a constitutional amendment.The court ruled that Article 368 does not enable Parliament in its constituent capacity to delegate its function of amending the Constitution to another legislature or to itself in its ordinary legislative capacity. This ruling made all the deemed constitutional amendments stipulated under the legislative powers of the parliament as void and inconsistent after the 24th constitutional amendment. These are articles 4 (2), 169 (3)-1962, 239A2-1962, 244A4-1969, 356 (1)c, para 7(2) of Schedule V and para 21(2) of Schedule VI. Also articles 239AA(7)b-1991, 243M(4)b-1992, 243ZC3-1992 and 312(4)-1977 which are inserted by later constitutional amendments and envisaging deemed constitutional amendments under legislative powers of the parliament, should be invalid. The Supreme Court declared in the case A. K. Roy, Etc vs Union Of India And Anr on 28 December, 1981 that the article 368(1) clearly defines constituent power as \'the power to amend any provision of the constitution by way of an addition, variation or repeal\'. it reiterated that constituent power must be exercised by the parliament itself in accordance with the procedure laid down in article 368.The Court upheld Section 2(a) and 2(b), and the first part of section 3 of the 25th Amendment as valid. However, the second part namely and no law containing a declaration that it is for giving effect to such policy shall be called in question in any court on the ground that it does not give effect to such policy was declared unconstitutional.The government of Indira Gandhi did not take kindly to this implied restriction on its powers by the court. On 26 April 1973, Justice Ajit Nath Ray, who was among the dissenters, was promoted to Chief Justice of India superseding three senior Judges, Shelat, Grover and Hegde, which was unprecedented in Indian legal history. Advocate C.K. Daphtary termed the incident as the blackest day in the history of democracy. Justice Mohammad Hidayatullah (previous Chief Justice of India) remarked that this was an attempt of not creating \'forward looking judges\' but \'judges looking forward\' to the office of Chief Justice.The government enacted the 42nd Amendment in 1976, to abrogate the Kesavananda Bharati ruling.'),(9211366,'Rugby_Central_railway_station','Rugby Central railway station.Rugby Central was a railway station serving Rugby in Warwickshire on the former Great Central Main Line which opened in 1899 and closed in 1969.It competed with the existing West Coast Main Line route for traffic to London which had served Rugby since the 1830s at Rugby Midland Station, which still exists, but since the closure of Rugby Central has reverted to its original name of Rugby.History.The station was opened on 15 March 1899. It had services between and via, and. As well as various cross country services to places such as Southampton and Hull.The station was run by the Great Central Railway from 1899 until it was grouped into the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923. It then came under the management of British Railways in 1948.Rugby Central was roughly midway along the Great Central Main Line (GCML) and was a stopping point for express services as well as a changeover point for local services. Until the early 1960s the station was served by about six London  Manchester expresses daily, and was the terminus for local services from or to the south, and Leicester Central or Nottingham Victoria from the north. The line was then run down and the express services were removed, leaving only the local services and an infrequent semi-fast service to London.Most of the GCML was closed on 5 September 1966 under Reshaping of British Railways. On this date, the line south of Rugby Central and north of Nottingham Victoria was closed. The section between Rugby Central and Nottingham (initially Nottingham Victoria, later cut back to) remained open as self-contained branch carrying a DMU operated local passenger service until 3 May 1969; the station formally closed on 5 May.Buildings and situation.Rugby Central was situated on Hillmorton Road roughly half a mile east of the town centre. It was much smaller and less important than Midland Station. Rugby Central was built to the standard Great Central design with a single island platform which was long.The booking office was at street level, built onto the side of the road bridge over the railway with the platform below. The platform was accessed by a covered staircase from the booking office. On the platform there were three waiting rooms and a toilet block, which was the only building not covered by the canopy.On the preserved Great Central Railway in Leicestershire, the preserved station is a similar design to the former Rugby Central.The site today.The station buildings were demolished after closure, although the platform still exists. Rugby Borough Council bought the whole of the former Great Central Railway trackbed through Rugby in 1970, and it is now a nature walk called the Great Central Way.The former goods yard was west of the station, and was used as a timber yard until the mid-1990s when houses were built on it.'),(10245612,'Los_Angeles_Asian_Pacific_Film_Festival','Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival.The Los Angeles Asian Pacific Film Festival (LAAPFF)  formerly known as VC FilmFest  is an annual film festival presented by Visual Communications (VC).

It first aired in 1997 on the Colombian Network RCN. The show was written by Bernardo Romero Pereira, and was his most successful telenovela after the globally distributed series Caf and Yo Soy Betty, La Fea.Story.Las Juanas follows an interesting storyline because it can be easily split in several stages that almost follow different plots. These chapters in which the telenovela is split makes think this story as a book-telenovela because in every stage the plot follows a different goal and once it is reached it change to another goal to be reached.Looking for the Calixto Salguero\'s daughters.The telenovela begins when Juana Valentina (Angie Cepeda) finds out the man she always thought to be her father really is not, but a man named Calixto, who lives in a rural small town named Corozal. Juana Valentina and her nanny - Teresalsura - travel to Corozal from their hometown Barranquilla looking for the man who is her father, there she meets Rubn a charming young man who has an instant chemistry with her. But it turns out that Ruben\'s father is named Calixto, so he may be her father. Juana Valentina begs not to be Ruben\'s half-sister, but when she interviews Ruben\'s parents asking if Calixto has a fish-shaped spot in his buttock, when Calixto\'s wife hears this, she reacts very badly but confirming to Juana Valentina she\'s Calixto\'s natural daughter and so Ruben\'s half-sister. Calixto (Pepe Sanchez), who is very scared after being reached by a thunder and still being alive and healthy, decides to find out the women he had been with 23 years ago when ironically he was trying to have a child with his wife, Doa (Judy Henriquez). Juana Valentina agrees to stay until finding if she has more siblings, so Juana Valentina, Ruben, Calixto and Calixto\'s best friend Judge Guerra starts a journey all along the Colombian Caribbean to find those women and potential siblings for Juana Valentina and Ruben.The first place they go to visit is Planeta Rica, where they find Juana Caridad (Catherine Siachoque) who is now a novice in a nuns convent, after Juana Caridad learns she has a family, she decides to leave the convent and join Juana Valentina. Later they go to another town Sahagn, where they meets an old friend of Doa, Margarita Cruz who is actually the mother of another daughter for Calixto Salguero, Juana Manny, a boxing apprentice, but the reason why Juana Manny decides to join her new family is very different from Juana Caridad, because Manny is just looking for the money Calixto can provides to her. Next station for the Salgueros is El Carmen de Bolivar, where they find another daughter of Calixto, Juana Bautista a fortune teller. The last daughter of Calixto was the hardest to find, but because they were looking for her in Santa Marta, while the girl, Juana Matilde is actually in Corozal and he was discovered for the fish-shaped spot in her buttock.The five girls all named Juana start to receive gifts and money from Calixto, for much of Doa\'s dismay, who develops a deep feeling of hate toward the five girls. Juana Valentina and Ruben are obviously attracted to each other, despite the fact they\'re siblings. Ruben\'s cousin Manuel Efe (Miguel Varoni) also has a crush on Juana Valentina and Ruben is always mad at him for being interested on his sister but also for his comic-derogatory behavior for the country because he is just coming to Colombia after years in Europe.This chapter concludes when Juana Valentina cancels her plans to go back to Barranquilla because Calixto loses all his money for a total failure in the cultivations, so her sisters and father need her.Bingo.After the Salgueros\'s bankruptcy, Juana Valentina decides to stay in Corozal to help in the situation, so she and her sisters - who now live in Doa\'s parents house named La Casa Rosada or The Pink House- decide to support their house and Doa\'s house while Ruben and Calixto put all the money and efforts to get the farm out of the ruin. The lack of job chances, lead the Juanas to be very creative in their attempts to get money, so their first idea is a Bingo.But ironically Doa -who has been receiving money from the Juanas without notice- with help of her nephew Manuel Efe is take this idea down making people believe that the Juanas are cheaing on them. In this point all the girls seem to have a love interest in the guys from Corozal. Juana Caridad dates Mauricio Fuentelafria, son of important politician, who used to have a crush on Juana Valentina but who after watching Juana Caridad almost naked and being charmed by the innocence of the girl decides to keep a relationship with her, but her very religious condition makes this a little bit harder for Mauricio. Juana Manny dates Octavio Portorreal.

MacHale, who wrote the pilot episode, stated: If memory serves, Ghostwriter was supposed to be an ancestor of Jamal\'s, who was an escaped slave from the south who educated himself and learned the value of reading.According to producer and writer Kermit Frazier, Ghostwriter was a runaway slave during the Civil War. He was killed by slave catchers and their dogs as he was teaching other runaway slaves how to read in the woods. His soul was kept in the book and released once Jamal discovered the book.The Ghostwriter team.When the show began, it was based around four main characters, all students at Zora Neale Hurston Middle School and Washington Elementary School in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, New York. The team later expanded to include six (later seven) active members, one MIA member, one member in Australia, two members in England, and three members in 1928.To become a member of the team, a kid would have to be able to read the words that Ghostwriter manipulates. There was normally an induction ceremony for each new member that joined the team. At this ceremony, they would be given a special pen with a string to be placed around the neck so the members could write to Ghostwriter no matter where they happened to be and to note all of the clues in their investigations. When a team meeting was required, one of the members would use Ghostwriter to send out the message rally, followed by the first initial of the member that was hosting the meeting (always either Jamal, Alex, Lenni or Gaby). Alex, Jamal, and Lenni also came up with a special Ghostwriter handshake for the team.Members of the team also use a casebook. A casebook is a binder with papers for noting all the suspects, evidence against them, and clues in their investigations, allowing the team to review them. Alex later coins the review under the term rewind, which the team likes and it became their catch phrase. As Gaby said, solving a case is like putting a jigsaw puzzle together, and the casebook is where (they) keep all the pieces. Basically, a casebook is an effective tool to start piecin\' the puzzle. Organizing stuff, getting it together. Ghostwriter would also read whatever was written within the casebook, and then help the team to find more clues. There\'s also another casebook especially made for Ghostwriter to help him figure out who he was.Jamal Jenkins.Jamal (portrayed by Sheldon Turnipseed) is level-headed and intelligent; the first person Ghostwriter reveals himself to and the de facto leader of the Ghostwriter team. In the first episode of the series, Ghost Story, Part 1, seventh grader Jamal is cleaning out the basement of his family\'s brownstone with his father, Reggie Jenkins (portrayed by Samuel L. Jackson in the first three cases and Dean Irby afterwards), when a spirit emerges from a book that has fallen on the ground and begins communicating with Jamal through words.Jamal lives with his parents and his grandmother (portrayed by Marcella Lowery); his older sister Danitra is away at college. Midway through the second season, Jamal\'s young cousin, Casey, also comes to stay with the family. Jamal\'s interests include karate and science; he dreams to one day be a scientist that performs experiments in outer space. Jamal applies for enrollment in the High School of Science in Who is Max Mouse?, and in Don\'t Stop the Music he is accepted.Lenni Frazier.Lenni (portrayed by Blaze Berdahl) is the second person to see Ghostwriter. A headstrong girl, Lenni is an aspiring singer, rapper, and songwriter. Lenni lives with her widowed father (portrayed by Richard Cox from the first season through the middle of the second season, and Keith Langsdale afterwards), in a loft above the Fernandezes\' bodega. Lenni\'s father is a musician. Her mother died when Lenni was a young child. Midway through the series, Lenni\'s father begins to date a British woman named Sally. Though Lenni likes Sally very much (she was the one who introduced them), she has trouble coping with her father\'s new relationship. Lenni is an avid comic book fan, and she also loves cooking with her father and reading Harriet the Spy (also her late mother\'s favorite book during her childhood).Alex Fernndez.Alejandro Alex Fernndez (portrayed by David Lpez) is the third person to be introduced to Ghostwriter. A first generation Salvadorian American and a sixth grader, Alex is an aspiring detective and skilled basketball player. Alex and his younger sister Gaby live with their parents (father portrayed by Shawn Elliot; mother portrayed by Cordielia Gonzalaz from the first season through the middle of the second season and Iliana Guibert afterwards) in the back of the family store (or bodega), which is located under Lenni\'s apartment. Alex is prone to a hot temper at times, but also displays a notable amount of courage and determination. Alex has several penpals all over the world.Gaby Fernndez.Gabriela Gaby Fernndez (portrayed by Mayteana Morales in the first two seasons and in A Crime of Two Cities; and by Melissa Gonzales in Four Days of the Cockatoo and Attack of the Slime Monster) is the fourth person to see Ghostwriter. She is Alex\'s younger sister, goes to Washington Elementary, and is best friends with her teammate Tina. She is 9years old in Am I Blue?. She is known for being quite talkative. However, she has a good sense of humor which usually manifests when she is teasing her brother, Alex. Of all the team members, Gaby is the one who appears closest to Ghostwriter on a personal level. Twice, she shows belated concern for Ghostwriter\'s safety (Just in Time and Who is Max Mouse?); she creates a word bed for him (Who is Max Mouse?), and she is shown playing a word game with Ghostwriter in Lost in Brooklyn. She is an aspiring newscaster.Tina Nguyen.Although Tina (portrayed by Tram-Anh Tran) is a Vietnamese American girl present in the first case of the series, she does not see Ghostwriter until the second case, Who Burned Mr. Brinker\'s Store? Despite not being involved with the team on their first case, she investigates it herself for her school and is intrigued by Alex and Jamal\'s investigation methods after she meets and befriends them. She eventually joins the team after meeting Ghostwriter. She wants to be a filmmaker, and is often seen with a camcorder in her hand, which comes in handy during several cases. She attends acting and film classes, and lives with her parents, her brother Tuan, and sister Linda in a traditionalist Vietnamese household. Tina is the first person in her family to be born in the United States. Her parents own a tailor shop which she helps run. Her best friend is Gaby, and she has a romantic relationship with Gaby\'s brother Alex.Rob Baker.Rob (portrayed by Todd Alexander) is a shy transfer student from a military family. He wants to be an author, and thus writes many different short stories and poems. Rob is aloof and is reluctant to join the Ghostwriter team at first. Rob is often impulsive and frequently gets himself in dangerous situations. He gets himself trapped in an abandoned subway tunnel, tied up by a maniacal stunt actress, and is nearly assaulted by a street gang when he enters their headquarters. Rob has a strained relationship with his father, who wishes Rob played more sports instead of writing. Rob\'s family decides to move to Australia during the Lost in Brooklyn case, and Rob\'s place in the team is assumed by Hctor.Hctor Carrero.Hector (portrayed by William Hernandez) joins the cast mid-way through season two. He meets Alex through the Big Brothers mentoring program. He was born in New York City, but grew up in Puerto Rico. He doesn\'t read and write English very well. Alex helps Hector in his writing and he is improving after joining the team. Hector particularly enjoys playing handball.Casey Austin.Casey (portrayed by Lateaka Vinson) joins the cast mid-way through season two. She is Jamal\'s younger cousin who lives in Detroit, but comes to live with the Jenkins while her mother Emmeline (Jamal\'s father\'s sister), is in the hospital being treated for alcoholism. Casey is a practical joker with a fondness for peanut butter.Craig Mitchell.Craig Mitchell (portrayed by Jeremy Miller) is an electronics expert, and only appears in the original pilot episode, Who Burned Mr. Brinker\'s Store?. After that case ends, he is never seen or mentioned again.Frank, Catherine, and Lucy.Frank Flynn, Catherine Canellan, and Lucy Canellan lived in Jamal\'s house in 1928; all are the children of Irish immigrants. Catherine and Lucy\'s father, a physician, was Frank\'s foster father and mentor in medicine. Ghostwriter helps Frank because of his future importance as a cardiac surgeon and to Jamal\'s family. Catherine was with him when Ghostwriter appeared in front of him, and he later writes to Lucy to convince her to help Frank.After the team helped prove his innocence, Frank eventually followed his mentor\'s footsteps to became a physician and worked at the Brooklyn Children Hospital. He was also a well-known philanthropist in the city who would help lower-class families who couldn\'t afford medical care.He performed a heart surgery on Jamal\'s father, Reginald Reggie Jenkins, when Reggie was four years old. This was pivotal to the formation of the Ghostwriter Team because if Frank hadn\'t operated on Reggie, Reggie would have died during his childhood. As a result, Jamal would have never been born and Ghostwriter would never have met Jamal. This meant the other team members would never have met Ghostwriter and the team would never have been formed. Under a causal loop of time travels, the Ghostwriter Team is inadvertently responsible of shaping Frank\'s life as a physician and his eventual operation on Reggie Jenkins, Jamal\'s and his sister Danitra\'s births, their first meeting among each other as seen on the five-part pilot episode Ghost Story, and other outcomes throughout the series because of the team\'s existence.Frank and Catherine are married at some point after they\'ve reached adulthood. Not only has Frank fulfilled his destiny as it should be, but Catherine also becomes a successful mystery novelist. Frank died on May 1, 1992, at the age of 76, a year before the team meets Catherine, and Lucy\'s fate is never revealed onscreen.Frank, Catherine, and Lucy only appear in the episode Just in Time. After that case ends, they are not seen or mentioned again. They were portrayed by Louis Todaro, Grace Johnston, and Stephi Lineburg, and the older version of Catherine was by Augusta Dabney.Sam and Becky.Sam and Becky Wentwood live in the United Kingdom. Their parents own a bed and breakfast. They met Jamal and Ghostwriter while Jamal\'s family was vacationing in London. They only appear in the episode A Crime of Two Cities. After that case ends, they are not seen or mentioned again. They were portrayed by Paul Francis and Candace Hallinan.Other cast members.Other cast members include Lt.

All but one were first published during 1800 in the second edition of Lyrical Ballads, a collaboration between Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge that was both Wordsworth\'s first major publication and a milestone in the early English Romantic movement. In the series, Wordsworth sought to write unaffected English verse infused with abstract ideals of beauty, nature, love, longing and death.The poems were written during a short period while the poet lived in Germany. Although they individually deal with a variety of themes, as a series they focus on the poet\'s longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing impatience with his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet\'s unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet\'s imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed the details of her origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.The Lucy poems consist of Strange fits of passion have I known, She dwelt among the untrodden ways, I travelled among unknown men, Three years she grew in sun and shower, and A slumber did my spirit seal. Although they are presented as a series in modern anthologies, Wordsworth did not conceive of them as a group, nor did he seek to publish the poems in sequence. He described the works as experimental in the prefaces to both the 1798 and 1800 editions of Lyrical Ballads, and revised the poems significantlyshifting their thematic emphasisbetween 1798 and 1799. Only after his death in 1850 did publishers and critics begin to treat the poems as a fixed group; anthologies since have generally presented them as a series.Lyrical Ballads.In 1798, Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge jointly published Lyrical Ballads, with a Few Other Poems, a collection of verses each had written separately. The book became hugely popular and was published widely; it is generally considered a herald of the Romantic movement in English literature. In it, Wordsworth aimed to use everyday language in his compositions as set out in the preface to the 1802 edition: The principal object, then, proposed in these Poems was to choose incidents and situations from common life, and to relate or describe them, throughout, as far as was possible in a selection of language really used by men, and at the same time, to throw over them a certain colouring of imagination, whereby ordinary things should be presented to the mind in an unusual aspect.The two poets had met three years earlier in either late August or September 1795 in Bristol. The meeting laid the foundation for an intense and profoundly creative friendship, based in part on their shared disdain for the artificial diction of the poetry of the era. Beginning in 1797, the two lived within walking distance of each other in Somerset, which solidified their friendship. Wordsworth believed that his life before meeting Coleridge was sedentary and dull, and that his poetry amounted to little. Coleridge influenced Wordsworth, and his praise and encouragement inspired Wordsworth to write prolifically. Dorothy, Wordsworth\'s sister, related the effect Coleridge had on her brother in a March 1798 letter: His faculties seem to expand every day, he composes with much more facility than he did, as to the mechanism [emphasis in original] of poetry, and his ideas flow faster than he can express them. With his new inspiration, Wordsworth came to believe he could write poetry rivalling that of John Milton. He and Coleridge planned to collaborate, but never moved beyond suggestions and notes for each other.The expiration of Wordsworth\'s Alfoxton House lease soon provided an opportunity for the two friends to live together. They conceived a plan to settle in Germany with Dorothy and Coleridge\'s wife, Sara, to pass the two ensuing years in order to acquire the German language, and to furnish ourselves with a tolerable stock of information in natural science. In September 1798, Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Dorothy travelled to Germany to explore proximate living arrangements, but this proved difficult. Although they lived together in Hamburg for a short time, the city was too expensive for their budgets. Coleridge soon found accommodations in the town of Ratzeburg in Schleswig-Holstein, which was less expensive but still socially vibrant. The impoverished Wordsworth, however, could neither afford to follow Coleridge nor provide for himself and his sister in Hamburg; the siblings instead moved to moderately priced accommodations in Goslar in Lower Saxony, Germany.Separation from Coleridge.Between October 1798 and February 1799, Wordsworth worked on the first draft of the Lucy poems together with a number of other verses, including the Matthew poems, Lucy Gray and The Prelude. Coleridge had yet to join the siblings in Germany, and Wordsworth\'s separation from his friend depressed him. In the three months following their parting, Wordsworth completed the first three of the Lucy poems: Strange fits, She dwelt, and A slumber. They first appeared in a letter to Coleridge dated December 1798, in which Wordsworth wrote that She dwelt and Strange fits were little Rhyme poems which I hope will amuse you. Wordsworth characterised the two poems thus to mitigate any disappointment Coleridge might suffer in receiving these two poems instead of the promised three-part philosophical epic The Recluse.Wordsworth partially blamed Dorothy for the abrupt loss of Coleridge\'s company. He felt that their financesinsufficient for supporting them both in Ratzeburgwould have easily supported him alone, allowing him to follow Coleridge. Wordsworth\'s anguish was compounded by the contrast between his life and that of his friend. Coleridge\'s financial means allowed him to entertain lavishly and to seek the company of nobles and intellectuals; Wordsworth\'s limited wealth constrained him to a quiet and modest life. Wordsworth\'s envy seeped into his letters when he described Coleridge and his new friends as more favored sojourners who may be chattering and chatter\'d to, through the whole day.Although Wordsworth sought emotional support from his sister, their relationship remained strained throughout their time in Germany. Separated from his friend and forced to live in the sole company of his sister, Wordsworth used the Lucy poems as an emotional outlet.Identity of Lucy.Wordsworth did not reveal the inspiration for the character of Lucy, and over the years the topic has generated intense speculation among literary historians. Little biographical information can be drawn from the poemsit is difficult even to determine Lucy\'s age. In the mid-19th century, Thomas DeQuincey (17851859), author and one-time friend of Wordsworth, wrote that the poet always preserved a mysterious silence on the subject of that \'Lucy\', repeatedly alluded to or apostrophised in his poems, and I have heard, from gossiping people about Hawkshead, some snatches of tragic story, which, after all, might be an idle semi-fable, improved out of slight materials.Critic Herbert Hartman believes Lucy\'s name was taken from a neo-Arcadian commonplace, and argues she was not intended to represent any single person. In the view of one Wordsworth biographer, Mary Moorman (19061994), The identity of \'Lucy\' has been the problem of critics for many years. But Wordsworth is a poet before he is a biographer, and neither \'Lucy\' nor her home nor his relations with her are necessarily in the strict sense historical. Nevertheless, as the Lyrical Ballads were all of them \'founded on fact\' in some way, and as Wordsworth\'s mind was essentially factual, it would be rash to say that Lucy is entirely fictitious.Moorman suggests that Lucy may represent Wordsworth\'s romantic interest Mary Hutchinson, but wonders why she would be represented as one who died. It is possible that Wordsworth was thinking of Margaret Hutchinson, Mary\'s sister who had died. There is no evidence, however, that the poet loved any of the Hutchinsons other than Mary. It is more likely that Margaret\'s death influenced but is not the foundation for Lucy.In 1980, Hunter Davies contended that the series was written for the poet\'s sister Dorothy, but found the LucyDorothy allusion bizarre. Earlier, literary critic Richard Matlak tried to explain the LucyDorothy connection, and wrote that Dorothy represented a financial burden to Wordsworth, which had effectively forced his separation from Coleridge. Wordsworth, depressed over the separation from his friend, in this interpretation, expresses both his love for his sister and fantasies about her loss through the poems. Throughout the poems, the narrator\'s mixture of mourning and antipathy is accompanied by denial and guilt; his denial of the LucyDorothy relationship and the lack of narratorial responsibility for the death of Lucy allow him to escape from questioning his desires for the death of his sister. After Wordsworth began the Lucy poems, Coleridge wrote, Some months ago Wordsworth transmitted to me a most sublime Epitaph / whether it had any reality, I cannot say. Most probably, in some gloomier moment he had fancied the moment in which his Sister might die. It is, however, possible that Wordsworth simply feared her death and did not wish it, even subconsciously.Literary scholar Karl Kroeber (19262009) argues that Lucy possesses a double existence; her actual, historical existence and her idealised existence in the poet\'s mind. In the poem, Lucy is both actual and idealised, but her actuality is relevant only insofar as it makes manifest the significance implicit in the actual girl. Hartman holds the same view; to him Lucy is seen entirely from within the poet, so that this modality may be the poet\'s own, but then he argues, she belongs to the category of spirits who must still become human... the poet describes her as dying at a point at which she would have been humanized. The literary historian Kenneth Johnston concludes that Lucy was created as the personification of Wordsworth\'s muse, and the group as a whole is a series of invocations to a Muse feared dead. As epitaphs, they are not sad, a very inadequate word to describe them, but breathlessly, almost aware of what such a loss would mean to the speaker: \'oh, the difference to me!\'Scholar John Mahoney observes that whether Lucy is intended to represent Dorothy, Mary or another is much less important to understanding the poems than the fact that she represented a hidden being who seems to lack flaws and is alone in the world. Furthermore, she is represented as being insignificant in the public sphere but of the utmost importance in the private sphere; in She dwelt this manifests through the comparison of Lucy to both a hidden flower and a shining star. Neither Lucy nor Wordsworth\'s other female characters exist as independent self-conscious human beings with minds as capable of the poet\'s and are rarely allowed to speak for themselves.The poems.The Lucy poems are written from the point of view of a lover who has long viewed the object of his affection from afar, and who is now affected by her death. Yet Wordsworth structured the poems so that they are not about any one person who has died; instead they were written about a figure representing the poet\'s lost inspiration. Lucy is Wordsworth\'s inspiration, and the poems as a whole are, according to Wordsworth biographer Kenneth Johnston, invocations to a Muse feared dead. Lucy is represented in all five poems as sexless; it is unlikely that the poet ever realistically saw her as a possible lover. Instead, she is presented as an ideal and represents Wordsworth\'s frustration at his separation from Coleridge; the asexual imagery reflects the futility of his longing.Wordsworth\'s voice slowly disappears from the poems as they progress, and his voice is entirely absent from the fifth poem. His love operates on the subconscious level, and he relates to Lucy more as a spirit of nature than as a human being. The poet\'s grief is private, and he is unable to fully explain its source. When Lucy\'s lover is present, he is completely immersed in human interactions and the human aspects of nature, and the death of his beloved is a total loss for the lover. The 20th-century critic Spencer Hall argues that the poet represents a fragile kind of humanism.Strange fits of passion have I known.Strange fits is probably the earliest of the poems and revolves around a fantasy of Lucy\'s death. It describes the narrator\'s journey to Lucy\'s cottage and his thoughts along the way. Throughout, the motion of the moon is set in opposition to the motion of the speaker. The poem contains seven stanzas, a relatively elaborate structure which underscores his ambivalent attitude towards Lucy\'s imagined death. The constant shifts in perspective and mood reflect his conflicting emotions. The first stanza, with its use of dramatic phrases such as fits of passion and dare to tell, contrasts with the subdued tone of the rest of the poem. As a lyrical ballad, Strange fits differs from the traditional ballad form, which emphasises abnormal action, and instead focuses on mood.The presence of death is felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, a symbol of the beloved, sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. That the speaker links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear. The moon nevertheless plays a significant role in the action of the poem: as the lover imagines the moon slowly sinking behind Lucy\'s cottage, he is entranced by its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trancehe sleeps while still keeping his eyes on the moon (lines 1720).The narrator\'s conscious presence is wholly absent from the next stanza, which moves forward in what literary theorist Geoffrey Hartman describes as a motion approaching yet never quite attaining its end. When the moon abruptly drops behind the cottage, the narrator snaps out of his dream, and his thoughts turn towards death. Lucy, the beloved, is united with the landscape in death, while the image of the retreating, entrancing moon is used to portray the idea of looking beyond one\'s lover. The darker possibility also remains that the dream state represents the fulfilment of the lover\'s fantasy through the death of the beloved. In falling asleep while approaching his beloved\'s home, the lover betrays his own reluctance to be with Lucy.<poem style=margin-left:20px>I told her this; her laughter lightAnd when I think upon that nightMy eyes are dim with tears.</poem>This final stanza lost its significance with the completion of the later poems in the series, and the revision allowed for a sense of anticipation at the poem\'s close and helped draw the audience into the story of the remaining Lucy poems. Of the other changes, only the description of the horse\'s movement is important: My horse trudg\'d on becomes With quickening pace my horse drew nigh, which heightens the narrator\'s vulnerability to fantasies and dreams in the revised version.She dwelt among the untrodden ways.She dwelt among the untrodden ways presents Lucy as having lived in solitude near the source of the River Dove. According to literary critic Geoffrey Durrant, the poem charts her growth, perfection, and death. To convey the dignified, unaffected naturalness of his subject, Wordsworth uses simple language, mostly words of one syllable. In the opening quatrain, he describes the isolated and untouched area where Lucy lived, as well as her innocence and beauty, which he compares to that of a hidden flower in the second. The poem begins in a descriptive rather than narrative manner, and it is not until the line When Lucy ceased to be that the reader is made aware that the subject of the verse has died. Literary scholar Mark Jones describes this effect as finding the poem is over before it has begun, while according to writer Margaret Oliphant (18281897), Lucy is dead before we so much as heard of her.Lucy\'s untrodden ways are symbolic of both her physical isolation and the unknown details of her thoughts and life. The third quatrain is written with an economy intended to capture the simplicity the narrator sees in Lucy. Her femininity is described in girlish terms. This has drawn criticism from those who see the female icon, in the words of literary scholar John Woolford, represented in Lucy by condemning her to death while denying her the actual or symbolic fulfillment of maternity. To evoke the loveliness of body and spirit, a pair of complementary but paradoxical images are employed in the second stanza: the solitary, hidden violet juxtaposed to the publicly visible Venus, emblem of love and first star of evening. Wondering if Lucy more resembles the violet or the star, the critic Cleanth Brooks (19061994) concludes that while Wordsworth likely views her as the single star, completely dominating [his] world, not arrogantly like the sun, but sweetly and modestly, the metaphor is a conventional compliment with only vague relevance. For Wordsworth, Lucy\'s appeal is closer to the violet and lies in her seclusion and her perceived affinity with nature.The narrator of the poem is less concerned with the experience of observing Lucy than with his reflections and meditations on his observations. Throughout the poem sadness and ecstasy are intertwined, a fact emphasised by the exclamation marks in the second and third verses. The critic Carl Woodring writes that She dwelt and the Lucy series can be read as elegiac, as sober meditation[s] on death. He found that they have the economy and the general air of epitaphs in the Greek Anthology... [I]f all elegies are mitigations of death, the Lucy poems are also meditations on simple beauty, by distance made more sweet and by death preserved in distance.<poem style=margin-left:20px>My hope was one, from cities far,Her lips were red as roses are,A fourth stanza, also later removed, included an explanation of how Lucy was to die: But slow distemper checked her bloom / And on the Heath she died.I travelled among unknown men.The last of the Lucy poems to be composed, I travelled among unknown men, was the only one not included in the second edition of Lyrical Ballads. Although Wordsworth claimed that the poem was composed while he was still in Germany, it was in fact written during April 1801. Evidence for this later date comes from a letter Wordsworth wrote to Mary Hutchinson referring to I travelled as a newly created poem. In 1802, he instructed his printer to place I travelled immediately after A slumber did my spirit seal in Lyrical Ballads, but the poem was omitted. It was later published in Poems, in Two Volumes in 1807.Nor will I quit thy shoreA second time; for still I seemTo love thee more and more. (lines 58)The first two stanzas seem to speak of the poet\'s personal experience, and a patriotic reading would reflect his appreciation and pride for the English landscape. The possibility remains, however, that Wordsworth is referring to England as a physical rather than a political entity, an interpretation that gains strength from the poem\'s connections to the other Lucy poems.Lucy only appears in the second half of the poem, where she is linked with the English landscape. As such, it seems as if nature joins with the narrator in mourning for her, and the reader is drawn into this mutual sorrow.Although I travelled was written two years after the other poems in the series, it echoes the earlier verses in both tone and language. Wordsworth gives no hint as to the identity of Lucy, and although he stated in the preface to Lyrical Ballads that all the poems were founded on fact, knowing the basis for the character of Lucy is not necessary to appreciating the poem and understanding its sentiment. Similarly, no insight can be gained from determining the exact geographical location of the springs of Dove; in his youth, Wordsworth had visited springs of that name in Derbyshire, Patterdale and Yorkshire.Three years she grew in sun and shower.Three years she grew in sun and shower was composed between 6 October and 28 December 1798. The poem depicts the relationship between Lucy and nature through a complex opposition of images. Antithetical couplings of wordssun and shower, law and impulse, earth and heaven, kindle and restrainare used to evoke the opposing forces inherent in nature. A conflict between nature and humanity is described, as each attempts to possess Lucy. The poem contains both epithalamic and elegiac characteristics; Lucy is shown as wedded to nature, while her human lover is left alone to mourn in the knowledge that death has separated her from humanity.A slumber did my spirit seal.Written in spare language, A slumber did my spirit seal consists of two stanzas, each four lines long. The first stanza is built upon even, soporific movement in which figurative language conveys the nebulous image of a girl who seemed a thing that could not feel / The touch of earthly years. The second maintains the quiet and even tone of the first but serves to undermine its sense of the eternal by revealing that Lucy has died and that the calmness of the first stanza represents death. The narrator\'s response to her death lacks bitterness or emptiness; instead he takes consolation from the fact that she is now beyond life\'s trials, and at last...in inanimate community with the earth\'s natural fixtures. The lifeless rocks and stones depicted in the concluding line convey the finality of Lucy\'s death.Grouping as a series.Although the Lucy poems share stylistic and thematic similarities, it was not Wordsworth but literary critics who first presented the five poems as a unified set called the Lucy poems. The grouping was originally suggested by critic Thomas Powell in 1831 and later advocated by Margaret Oliphant in an 1871 essay. The 1861 Golden Treasury, compiled by the English historian Francis Palgrave (17881861), groups only four of the verses, omitting Strange fits. The poems next appeared as a complete set of five in the collection of Wordsworth\'s poems by English poet and critic Matthew Arnold (18221888).The grouping and sequence of the Lucy poems has been a matter of debate in literary circles. Various critics have sought to add poems to the group; among those proposed over the years are Alcaeus to Sappho, Among all lovely things, Lucy Gray, Surprised by joy, Tis said, that some have died for love, Louisa, Nutting, Presentiments, She was a Phantom of delight, The Danish Boy, The Two April Mornings, To a Young Lady, and Written in Very Early Youth. None of the proposals have met with widespread acceptance. The five poems included in the Lucy canon focus on similar themes of nature, beauty, separation and loss, and most follow the same basic ballad form. Literary scholar Mark Jones offers a general characterisation of a Lucy poem as an untitled lyrical ballad that either mentions Lucy or is always placed with another poem that does, that either explicitly mentions her death or is susceptible of such a reading, and that is spoken by Lucy\'s lover.With the exception of A slumber, all of the poems mention Lucy by name. The decision to include this work is based in part on Wordsworth\'s decision to place it in close proximity to Strange fits and directly after She dwelt within Lyrical Ballads. In addition, I travelled was sent to the poet\'s childhood friend and later wife, Mary Hutchinson, with a note that said it should be read after \'She dwelt\'. Coleridge biographer J. Dykes Campbell records that Wordsworth instructed I travelled to be included directly following A slumber, an arrangement that indicates a connection between the poems. Nevertheless, the question of inclusion is further complicated by Wordsworth\'s eventual retraction of these instructions and his omission of I travelled from the two subsequent editions of Lyrical Ballads.The 1815 edition of Lyrical Ballads organised the poems into the Poems Founded on the Affections (Strange fits, She dwelt, and I travelled) and Poems of the Imagination (Three years she grew and A slumber). This arrangement allowed the two dream-based poems (Strange fits and A slumber) to frame the series and to represent the speaker\'s different sets of experiences over the course of the longer narrative. In terms of chronology, I travelled was written last, and thus also served as a symbolic conclusionboth emotionally and thematicallyto the Lucy poems.Nature.According to critic Norman Lacey, Wordsworth built his reputation as a poet of nature. Early works, such as Tintern Abbey, can be viewed as odes to his experience of nature. His poems can also be seen as lyrical meditations on the fundamental character of the natural world. Wordsworth said that, as a youth, nature stirred an appetite, a feeling and a love, but by the time he wrote Lyrical Ballads, it evoked the still sad music of humanity.The five Lucy poems are often interpreted as representing Wordsworth\'s opposing views of nature as well as meditations on the cycle of life. They describe a variety of relationships between humanity and nature. For example, Lucy can be seen as a connection between humanity and nature, as a boundary being, nature sprite and human, yet not quite either. She reminds us of the traditional mythical person who lives, ontologically, an intermediate life, or mediates various realms of existence. Although the poems evoke a sense of loss, they also hint at the completeness of Lucy\'s lifeshe was raised by nature and survives in the memories of others. She became, in the opinion of the American poet and writer David Ferry (b. 1924), not so much a human being as a sort of compendium of nature, while her death was right, after all, for by dying she was one with the natural processes that made her die, and fantastically ennobled thereby.Cleanth Brooks writes that Strange fits presents Kind Nature\'s gentlest boon, Three years its duality, and A slumber the clutter of natural object. Other scholars see She dwelt, along with I travelled, as representing nature\'s rustication and disappearance. Mahoney views Three years as describing a masculine, benevolent nature similar to a creator deity. Although nature shapes Lucy over time and she is seen as part of nature herself, the poem shifts abruptly when she dies. Lucy appears to be eternal, like nature itself. Regardless, she becomes part of the surrounding landscape in life, and her death only verifies this connection.The series presents nature as a force by turns benevolent and malign. It is shown at times to be oblivious to and uninterested in the safety of humanity. Hall argues, In all of these poems, nature would seem to betray the heart that loves her. The imagery used to evoke these notions serves to separate Lucy from everyday reality. The literary theorist Frances Ferguson (b. 1947) notes that the flower similes and metaphors become impediments rather than aids to any imaginative visualization of a woman; the flowers do not simply locate themselves in Lucy\'s cheeks, they expand to absorb the whole of her... The act of describing seems to have lost touch with its goaldescription of Lucy.Death.The poems Wordsworth wrote while in Goslar focus on the dead and dying. The Lucy poems follow this trend, and often fail to delineate the difference between life and death. Each creates an ambiguity between the sublime and nothingness, as they attempt to reconcile the question of how to convey the death of a girl intimately connected to nature. They describe a rite of passage from innocent childhood to corrupted maturity and, according to Hartman, center on a death or a radical change of consciousness which is expressed in semi-mythical form; and they are, in fact, Wordsworth\'s nearest approach to a personal myth. The narrator is affected greatly by Lucy\'s death and cries out in She dwelt of the difference to me!. Yet in A slumber he is spared from trauma by sleep.The reader\'s experience of Lucy is filtered through the narrator\'s perception. Her death suggests that nature can bring pain to all, even to those who loved her. According to the British classical and literary scholar H. W. Garrod (18781960), The truth is, as I believe, that between Lucy\'s perfection in Nature and her death there is, for Wordsworth, really no tragic antithesis at all. Hartman expands on this view to extend the view of death and nature to art in general: Lucy, living, is clearly a guardian spirit, not of one place but of all English places... while Lucy, dead, has all nature for her monument. The series is a deeply humanized version of the death of Pan, a lament on the decay of English natural feeling. Wordsworth fears that the very spirit presiding over his poetry is ephemeral, and I think he refuses to distinguish between its death in him and its historical decline.Critical assessment.Later, the essayist Charles Lamb (17751834) wrote to Wordsworth in 1801 to say that She dwelt was one of his favourites from Lyrical Ballads. Likewise Romantic poet John Keats (17951821) praised the poem. To the diarist and writer Henry Crabb Robinson (17751867), She dwelt gave the powerful effect of the loss of a very obscure object upon one tenderly attached to itthe opposition between the apparent strength of the passion and the insignificance of the object is delightfully conceived.Besides word of mouth and opinions in letters, there were only a few published contemporary reviews. The writer and journalist John Stoddart (17731856), in a review of Lyrical Ballads, described Strange fits and She dwelt as the most singular specimens of unpretending, yet irresistible pathos. An anonymous review of Poems in Two Volumes in 1807 had a less positive opinion about I travell\'d: Another string of flat lines about Lucy is succeeded by an ode to Duty. Critic Francis Jeffrey (17731850) claimed that, in Strange fits, Mr Wordsworth, however, has thought fit to compose a piece, illustrating this copious subject by one single thought. A lover trots away to see his mistress one fine evening, staring all the way at the moon: when he comes to her door, \'O mercy! to myself I cried, / If Lucy should be dead!\' And there the poem ends! On A slumber did my spirit seal, Wordsworth\'s friend Thomas Powell wrote that the poem stands by itself, and is without title prefixed, yet we are to know, from the penetration of Mr. Wordsworth\'s admirers, that it is a sequel to the other deep poems that precede it, and is about one Lucy, who is dead. From the table of contents, however, we are informed by the author that it is about \'A Slumber;\' for this is the actual title which he has condescended to give it, to put us out of pain as to what it is about.Many Victorian critics appreciated the emotion of the Lucy poems and focused on Strange fits. John Wilson, a personal friend of both Wordsworth and Coleridge, described the poem in 1842 as powerfully pathetic. In 1849, critic Rev. Francis Jacox, writing under the pseudonym Parson Frank, remarked that Strange fits contained true pathos. We are moved to our soul\'s centre by sorrow expressed as that is; for, without periphrasis or wordy anguish, without circumlocution of officious and obtrusive, and therefore, artificial grief; the mourner gives sorrow words... But he does it in words as few as may be: how intense their beauty! A few years later, John Wright, an early Wordsworth commentator, described the contemporary perception that Strange fits had a deep but subdued and \'silent fervour\'. Other reviewers emphasised the importance of She dwelt among the untrodden ways, including Scottish writer William Angus Knight (18361916), when he described the poem as an incomparable twelve lines.At the beginning of the 20th century, literary critic David Rannie praised the poems as a whole: that strange little lovely group, which breathe a passion unfamiliar to Wordsworth, and about which heso ready to talk about the genesis of his poemshas told us nothing [...] Let a poet keep some of his secrets: we need not grudge him the privacy when the poetry is as beautiful as this; when there is such celebration of girlhood, love, and death [...] The poet\'s sense of loss is sublime in its utter simplicity. He finds harmony rather than harshness in the contrast between the illusion of love and the fact of death. Later critics focused on the importance of the poems to Wordsworth\'s poetic technique. Durrant argued that The four \'Lucy\' poems which appeared in the 1800 edition of Lyrical Ballads are worth careful attention, because they represent the clearest examples of the success of Wordsworth\'s experiment. Alan Grob (19322007) focused less on the unity that the poems represent and believed that the principal importance of the \'Matthew\' and \'Lucy\' poems, apart from their intrinsic achievement, substantial as that is, is in suggesting the presence of seeds of discontent even in a period of seemingly assured faith that makes the sequence of developments in the history of Wordsworth\'s thought a more orderly, evolving pattern than the chronological leaps between stages would seem to imply.Later critics de-emphasised the significance of the poems in Wordsworth\'s artistic development. Hunter Davies (b. 1936) concluded that their impact relies more on their popularity than importance to Wordsworth\'s poetic career. Davies went on to claim, The poems about Lucy are perhaps Wordsworth\'s best-known work which he did in Germany, along with \'Nutting\' and the Matthew poems, but the most important work was the beginning of The Prelude (emphasis in original). Some critics emphasised the importance behind Lucy as a figure, including Geoffrey Hartman (b. 1929), when he claimed, It is in the Lucy poems that the notion of spirit of place, and particularly English spirit of place, reaches its purest form. Writer and poet Meena Alexander (b. 1951) believed that the character of Lucy is the impossible object of the poet\'s desire, an iconic representation of the Romantic feminine.Parodies and allusions.The Lucy poems have been parodied numerous times since their first publication. These were generally intended to ridicule the simplification of textual complexities and deliberate ambiguities in poetry. They also questioned the way many 19th-century critics sought to establish definitive readings. According to Jones, such parodies commented in a meta-critical manner and themselves present an alternative mode of criticism. Among the more notable is the one by Samuel Taylor Coleridge\'s son Hartley Coleridge (17961849), called On William Wordsworth or simply Imitation, as in the 1827 version published for The Inspector magazine (He lived amidst th\' untrodden ways / To Rydal Lake that lead; / A Bard whom there were none to praise / And very few to read lines 14). Parody also appears in the 1888 murder-mystery reading of the poem by Victorian author Samuel Butler (18351902). Butler believed Wordsworth\'s use of the phrase the difference to me! was overly terse, and remarked that the poet was most careful not to explain the nature of the difference which the death of Lucy will occasion him to be... The superficial reader takes it that he is very sorry she was dead... but he has not said this. Not every work referring to the Lucy poems is intended to mock, however; the novelist and essayist Mary Shelley (17971851) drew upon the poems to comment on and re-imagine the Romantic portrayal of femininity.Settings.The Lucy poems (omitting I travelled among unknown men but adding Among all lovely things) have been set for voice and piano by the composer Nigel Dodd. The settings were first performed at St George\'s, Brandon Hill, Bristol, in October 1995 at a concert marking the bicentenary of the first meeting of Wordsworth and Coleridge.Among settings of individual poems is Benjamin Britten\'s Lucy (I travelled among unknown men) composed in 1926.'),(13794826,'Girl_in_a_Coma','Girl in a Coma.Girl In a Coma is an indie rock band from San Antonio, Texas formerly on Joan Jett\'s Blackheart Records\' label. The band is made up of sisters Nina (vocals/guitar) and Phanie Diaz (drums) and long-time friend, Jenn Alva (bass). The name is a reference to The Smiths\' song Girlfriend in a Coma. Before they were called Girl in a Coma, they were Sylvia\'s Radio and Girls in a Coma.History.Nina Diaz is the youngest member of Girl in a Coma. There is an eight-year age difference between her and the other band members.Nina is lead-singer and lyricist. Her sister Phanie and Jenn asked her to join their band after she shared a song she had written. Her first show was a week before her 14th birthday. At the age of 16 Nina decided to dedicate her energy to the band and left high school. Nina\'s decision was difficult. She was very close to finishing but realized that her focus was the band. Nina\'s distinctive voice and powerful live performances attracted the attention of fans, producers and fellow artists. In 2009, Nina collaborated with Tisto to co-write the dance track, In Your Mind. At the start of 2014, Nina Diaz, decided to take a break from Girl in a Coma to head into the studio to record this new solo material.Nina and Phanie are Mexican American. Although the girls grew up only being able to understand Spanish, Nina has made it her goal to learn to speak and write in Spanish. She has expressed a desire to incorporate ethnic pride into her music. Nina and Phanie grew up in Texas listening to Tejano music, and as such they listened to a lot of Selena\'s music. they have integrated these cultural elements into their band as well.Phanie believes in the practice of curanderismo.Phanie\'s name is actually Stephanie but she has always gone by Phanie. She started learning how to play the acoustic guitar when she was eleven and eventually she learned how to play Nirvana chords. Jenn Alva and Phanie met in 8th grade in art class where they became best friends. Jenn and Phanie, both having a love for rock/punk music and both with the ability to play instruments, started up a band.The band started with little money and much moral support from parents and friends. It was hard at first, they did the best they could by buying all the instruments and tools they could to begin to create music of their own. Prior to the group\'s first album, they were taken in by a fellow friend of theirs giving them a place to stay so they could focus entirely on their music.Girl in a Coma hoped to record their first album with Erick and Gabe, two producers impressed by Girl in a Coma\'s live shows. Girl in a Coma was to be the first band that they signed to their up and coming music label.In 2006, while filming the television series pilot for the SiTV show Jammin, the girls met one of their musical idols, Joan Jett. Joan Jett and producer Kenny Laguna signed the girls to a contract with Blackheart Records as a result of seeing them perform at the Knitting Factory in New York City for the television show.In October 2007, while in New York, Girl in a Coma were called by Morrissey to open for the remainder of his tour.Besides Morrissey, Girl in a Coma have opened for Frank Black, The Pogues, Tegan and Sara, Social Distortion and many more.The band played at the SXSW Music Festival in 2007, 2009, and again in 2010 and 2012. They also performed on the True Colors Tour 2008.In early 2008, their song Clumsy Sky won in The 7th Annual Independent Music Awards for Best Punk Song.In the summer of 2010, Girl in a Coma played at Polish Woodstock in front of a crowd of 300,000.In 2012, they won another Independent Music Award with their album Exits & All The Rest for Best Indie/Alt. Album.Drummer Phanie Diaz and bass player Jenn Alva are both openly lesbian. Jenn is currently married and has been out lesbian for a longer time than Phanie. Phanie was hesitant at first on coming out because she wanted her mother to know first. She wrote a letter to her telling her that she was lesbian. Her mom was very accepting. Another reason why Phanie did not want to publicly announce her sexual orientation was because she did not want the public to focus on that and put them into a gay band box.2007.On May 1, 2007 the band came out with a new song called I\'ll ask him. You can listen to the song here2009.On March 22, 2009 group member Jenn Alva and Nina Diaz were arrested outside of a Houston club. They were briefly detained and processed at a Harris County jail. Both were charged with felony assault on a public servant. The incident began when one of the officers, who was working as a security guard, saw Diaz slap her boyfriend and attempted to separate the couple.2011.On August 14, 2011 Girl in a Coma performed at the Seattle Woodland Park. They were the opening band for the GO-Gos which was a huge success. These girls have a passion a determination when it comes to playing powerful music. Opening all-female band Girl in a Coma surely was a nod to the Go-Gos punk rock roots. The trio slashed through their set aggressive songs with more than a little Seattle grunge influence  with great dramatic and explosive stage presence. According to an article by Michele Costanza, she stated I think its possible that some of the +50 and -10 age-demographics in the crowd were a little confused by Girl in a Comas pairing with the much more poppy Go-Gos, but I dont think thats a bad thing.2014.In 2014, Nina Diaz, the songwriter/vocalist/guitarist of Girl in a Coma is taking time off the band to launch a solo album.While Nina takes time off to launch her solo album, Phanie and Jenn are starting up a new band with guitarist, Annette Iglesias, and singer, Theresa Moher called FEA. Girl in a Coma announces it is not breaking up. They\'re just simply taking a break.Musical style and influences.Self-identified by its members as an Indie Rock band, Girl in a Coma creates music that breaks conventions in order to escape the categorization of a single rock genre. Through identifying as such, a freedom to create music that provides, as band member Nina Diaz describes, The ability to sing, and scream, and break from personal inhibitions becomes more accessible. The band\'s emphasis on the importance of freedom and uncategorized musical expression truly provides an opportunity for Girl in a Coma to further embody the diversity of the bands many musical influences.Girl in a Comas unique musical style, that combines the essence of many rock genres, is generated from the large and eclectic group of musical influences including, Nirvana, girl groups such as Bratmobile and Bikini Kill, the Ramones, and the Smiths, whose song Girlfriend in a Coma is attributed to the inspiration for the band\'s name. At the top of the list, band members Phanie and Nina Diaz describe their grandfather as their first prominent musical influence. His passion for music, singing, and guitar playing witnessed at a young age by Phanie and Nina Diaz, has had a profound influence on the bands music as well as the title of their second album, Trio B.C., titled after their grandfathers Tejano band from the 1950s. As stated by Phanie Diaz, His passion is our inspiration. We hope to make people feel that way about our music.In conjunction to their grandfathers inspiration, a prominent influence can also be found through Girl in a Coma\'s lasting connection to Tex-Mex music. Though not always witnessed directly through the production of the band\'s music, Tex-Mex influences are ingrained through the history of Girl in a Coma and each members\' origins in San Antonio, Texas. The momentous impact of their background in this community is a primary reason for the literal and symbolic connection Girl in a Coma has with Tex-Mex music which band member Jenn Alva explains, Is not intentional, it just is because that musical sound has always surrounded us. This standing idea and comfort of Tex-Mex music in each band member\'s life has not only influenced the music that they play but the genre of Tex-Mex itself. As described by Deborah Vargas, Girl in a Comas music moves within and through Tex-Mex soundbut is not necessarily of it, thereby enabling an alternative racialized gendered sensibility of what constitutes Tex-Mex.Cultural Background.Felix Contreras of National Public Radio (NPR) conducted an interview with Girl in a Coma where they opened up about not speaking Spanish and not knowing the language well. Nina Diaz, the lead singer and guitarist, said, When the grandparents were talking to my older sister, or even adult conversations, you could hear them talking and it felt like a foreign thing, She also said, It\'s like, \'What are you saying? I want to understand you.\' But then I would go off and play with my toys, and was like, \'Whatever, I guess I\'ll understand it later.\'In another interview, by www.musicpix.net the band members said that they do not like to label themselves as a Latina, lesbian, or girl band, because they do not want to be put in a box. Girl in a Coma does say that if they were anything they would say they are a rock and roll band even though there are punk rock, oldies Spanish music, indie, as well as rock and roll influences in their music. However, they also said they do not want to make it about themselves, because it is all about the music.In the interview by www.musicpix.net of Girl in a Coma, the band said that they had influences from Selena Quintanilla, especially because she was also from Texas and she was the first Latina to break out in a male dominated industry. They covered her song Si Una Vez in their album Coverland. The band also mentioned in their interview that they would love to have a complete Spanish album in the future.Activism.Girl in a Coma has been involved in social issues affecting the LGBTQ and Latino community. They have stood up to stereotypes and unfair policies through their music. In 2012, Girl in a Coma got together with to campaign against Arizonas anti-immigration SB 1070 law. According to the Huffington Post, the band was pulled over and question by authorities in Mobile, Alabama. In an interview, Phanie Diaz does not consider Girl in a Coma to be activists or a political band. Even though we are not self-identified [as activists], we do pay attentionwe have youth, the gay community and the Latino community all paying attention to what we are doing and supporting us so if we can give back, we can.In a separate interview with GA Voice, Jenn Alva stated that there had to be a different way to approach immigration. Our country is taking steps in the wrong directionTheres got to be another way. We need to work to help them and see what brilliant compromise that we can establish. The song Hope on Exits and all the Rests was written about Arizonas anti-immigration law.Social media.Girl in a Coma utilizes social media to connect with fans. They use Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Their social media promotes upcoming shows and informs fans of new projects they are working on. Not only do they promote what Girl in a Coma is doing collectively, but their space is also used to promote projects that individual members are working on. An example of this is Nina, the lead singer, performing with a new band at the Belmont in Austin, Texas. Also promoted is the FEA tour presented by Phanie and Jenn.A third way in which GIAC use their social media is to share the life they live in between the performances. Specifically speaking of their Instagram account, GIAC in the past has shared pictures wishing their fans a Merry Christmas or posting pictures of them doing something silly. The goal of GIAC and their use of social media is to engage and interact with their fans as much as possible.2006 Documentary.Jim Mendiola, the director of many of Girl in a Comas music videos, directed the Girl in a Coma an episode of Jammin for SiTV. This 2006 episode captured the girls in their music element: writing songs, recording, performing, and interviewing, all in their hometown of San Antonio, Texas.

The election took place in Toronto and on the Internet. At the Leadership Convention, held at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, Thomas Mulcair was declared to be the new leader of the party. The convention was to be held at Exhibition Place\'s Allstream Centre, but it was moved to the larger venue due to a greater than expected number of delegates registering for the event.The vote was open to all NDP members in a combination of exhaustive ballot and instant-runoff voting with one member, one vote (OMOV); each member voted by preferential ballot in advance, or with a single ballot for each round on the day of the election. The entrance fee was set at $15,000 and each candidate\'s spending limit was capped at $500,000.Mulcair is the NDP\'s seventh leader elected since its founding in 1961. Because the NDP is the Official Opposition, he also assumed the position of Leader of the Official Opposition in the Canadian House of Commons.Convention timing.In a letter written days before his death, Layton recommended that a leadership election be held as early as possible in 2012 on approximately the same time lines as in 2003, and that Nycole Turmel, who had been appointed interim leader because of his illness, continue in that role until the election of a permanent leader. Turmel initially said that the party intended to hold the leadership election in January 2012. Others, including party president Brian Topp and Deputy Leader Thomas Mulcairboth prospective candidatescalled for a longer race. Topp agreed with calls for a vote later in the year, such as February or March. Mulcair said he would not run if the convention is held too early. Like Topp, he suggests a convention in late winter or early spring. He also pointed out that such a time frame would be consistent with the last leadership election, which took 7.5 months (June 6, 2002  January 23, 2003). On September 9, the NDP federal council set the election for March 24, 2012, in Toronto.The longer timeline was to allow more members to be recruited in Quebec, which had low numbers of NDP members but, following the Orange Crush in the recent election, the bulk of the party\'s MPs.Election rules.The leadership election was open to all members during a convention in a combination of exhaustive ballot and instant-runoff voting. Votes mailed in advance were cast by instant-runoff voting, but votes on the day, either at the convention or online, were for one round only. Candidates could withdraw before being formally eliminated and release preferences to lower down candidates who stay in. In the 2003 leadership election, members were able to vote in person at the convention, by mail, or online. Also in that election, affiliated organizations (such as trade unions) were allotted a minimum of 25 percent of the vote, with the remainder held by individual party members. The party\'s federal executive ruled in September 2011 that a 2006 change to the party constitution mandating one member, one vote precluded a carve out for affiliated groups.Party president and leadership candidate Brian Topp supported retaining the carve-out as did former MP Dawn Black, while MPs Thomas Mulcair, Peter Stoffer, and Pat Martin opposed it. In previous leadership elections, a union\'s delegates would normally vote as a block making union endorsements an important factor in the outcome.Candidates in the campaign had a $500,000 spending limit.On September 14, 2011, interim party leader Nycole Turmel announced rules for candidates from the federal caucus that would have members of the caucus executive, e.g., deputy leaders, to stay in their posts, but would require critics and committee chairs and vice chairs to step down if they chose to join the race.Leadership debates.The candidates participated in six debates, in Ottawa, Halifax, Quebec City, Winnipeg, Montreal and Vancouver.

He is fluently trilingual having been raised speaking Cree, English, and French.Saganash announced on February 9, 2012 that he was withdrawing from the race, citing illness in his family and a lack of confidence in his campaign. On March 7, 2012, he endorsed Thomas Mulcair for leadership.August 2011.A poll conducted between August 23 and 28, 2011, indicated that 51% of Canadians did not know who was best to lead the NDP. Thomas Mulcair and Olivia Chow each support from 14% of respondents, while Bob Rae was selected by 9%. Brian Topp and Nycole Turmel each received 3% support.September 2011.A survey conducted by Angus Reid Public Opinion on September 20 and 21, 2011, found that 28% of Canadian voters would vote for the NDP if it was headed by Mulcair and 25% of Canadians would support the NDP under Topp.A survey conducted by Leger Marketing between September 12 and 15, 2011, found that 17% of NDP supporters favoured Mulcair as leader. Topp received support from 10% of the same group. Saganash received support from 1% of Quebec NDP voters, but no support outside the province. Paul Dewar received support from 3% of NDP voters in Canada, Peggy Nash and Nathan Cullen each received 2% support and Peter Julian received 1% of the support.A Harris-Decima poll conducted between September 1 and 4, 2011, showed support for Chow at 19%, Mulcair at 14%, Gary Doer at 6%, Paul Dewar at 3%, and Libby Davies, Topp, Peter Julian and Robert Chisholm all at 2%. Among NDP supporters, 22% would support Chow, 21% Mulcair, 7% for Doer, 4% for Dewar and Davies each, 3% for Julian and just 2% for Topp and Chisholm each.December 2011.A survey conducted by Forum Research for the National Post on December 13, 2011, surveyed 300 NDP supporters on their opinions for NDP leader. Of those surveyed, 47% were undecided. The remaining 53% of supporters were split between Thomas Mulcair (45%), Peggy Nash (16%) with Paul Dewar and Brian Topp at 8%.January 2012.A survey conducted by Abacus Data asked respondents whether they were aware of the candidates running for the leadership of the NDP. Thomas Mulcair and Brian Topp were the most likely to be known by respondents. 36% of respondents were aware of Thomas Mulcair while 31% were aware of Brian Topp. Paul Dewar (27% aware) and Peggy Nash (23%) rounded out the top four. Among NDP supporters (those who said they would vote NDP if an election were held the time of the poll), the order was the same with Mulcair (38%), Topp (32%), Dewar (27%), and Nash (21%) in the top four. Over three in ten NDP supporters had not heard of any of the candidates prior to our poll. Regionally, Mulcair\'s name recognition in Quebec exceeded all other competitors in all other regions of the country and his national lead in name recognition was almost entirely due to Quebecers\' awareness of him. 64%of Quebec respondents were aware of Thomas Mulcair. Outside of Quebec, Mulcair\'s name recognition never exceeded 25%.A Forum Research poll for the National Post on January 18, 2012, surveyed 1,200 Canadians on their opinions for NDP leader. Of those surveyed, 14% supported Thomas Mulcair, followed by 6% for Peggy Nash, 5% each for Brian Topp and Paul Dewar, 3% for Romeo Saganash, and 2% each for Niki Ashton, Nathan Cullen, and Martin Singh. Of the 300 self-declared NDP supporters, Mulcair won 19% support, again followed by Nash (10%), Topp (6%), Dewar (6%), Saganash (4%), Cullen (4%), Singh (2%), and Ashton (1%), while 48% of NDP supporters were undecided. Among decided NDP supporters, Mulcair was supported by 36%, followed by Nash (20%), Topp (11%), Dewar (11%), Saganash (8%), Cullen (7%), Singh (4%) and Ashton (3%)February 2012.On February 13, Paul Dewar\'s campaign partially released the results of an IVR poll commissioned by them and held on February 8 & 9. With responses from 6,373 households in every region of Canada, the first choice responses weighted by NDP membership per province for decided voters were: Thomas Mulcair 25.5%, Peggy Nash 16.8%, Paul Dewar 15.1%, Nathan Cullen 12.8%, Brian Topp 12.7%, Niki Ashton 9.5%, Martin Singh 4.1%, Romeo Saganash 3.6%. 31.0% of respondents were undecided. In response, the Topp campaign responded saying their own surveys place him at 28%.March 2012.In the run-up to the convention, Thomas Mulcair was predicted as leading the pack.Convention.Just prior to the convention opening, Brian Topp and Ed Broadbent, both defined the race as staying true to the NDP cause, by going with Topp, or moving to the centre and away from its current principles by going with Thomas Mulcair. Pundits had comparisons with New Labour in Britain under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, with Mulcair\'s stance on the party.The first day, March 23, was devoted to candidate speeches and a tribute to Jack Layton. Peggy Nash was seen by many to have bad time management skills, having run out of time, and being ushered out by music to indicate end of time. That was due to overly long introductory portion of her 20 minute allotment. Thomas Mulcair also disappointed by having to speed through his speech after a similar overly long introduction by supporters, instead of having a great speech as anticipated, to end in a timely manner and not be ushered out for being over time. Brian Topp was considered to have one of the most polished presentations, while Nathan Cullen distinguished himself by speaking without notes or a teleprompter.Entering balloting day, pundits predicted the perceived front runner, Thomas Mulcair, would receive support in the first round between 30 and 35 percent, though some people in the Mulcair camp predicted 40 percent. Pundits expected a clear multi-ballot win if Mulcair received 35 percent or more, and a multi-ballot slugout if his share was nearer 30 percent, which would allow other challengers to catch up and beat him.Voting for the first round ended up at roughly half the 128,351 eligible voters, lower than expected but still much higher than the usual participation rates at conventions. This was likely due to the fact that all eligible NDP members could vote, and not just convention delegates. Participation was still lower that the roughly 60% of the general electorate who voted in the last national general election however.Most of Martin Singh\'s supporters, according to pundits, migrated to Thomas Mulcair, accounting for most of Mulcair\'s rise on the second ballot.After Peggy Nash was eliminated in the second ballot, her supporters split fairly evenly between the three remaining candidates, for the third ballot, surprising many pundits. During the voting for the third ballot, the NDP polling site was the target of a denial-of-service attack, forcing a prolongation of the voting period, and separating voting from those at the convention and those at home.Brain Topp ultimately finished second on the fourth and final ballot with 42.8% of the vote to Mulcair\'s 57.2%, allowing Thomas Mulcair to win the leadership.'),(30729773,'Gentianella_alborosea','Gentianella alborosea.Gentianella alborosea is a species of plant in the Gentianaceae family.

The process involves the high-pressure injection of \'fracking fluid\' (primarily water, containing sand or other proppants suspended with the aid of thickening agents) into a wellbore to create cracks in the deep-rock formations through which natural gas, petroleum, and brine will flow more freely. When the hydraulic pressure is removed from the well, small grains of hydraulic fracturing proppants (either sand or aluminium oxide) hold the fractures open.Hydraulic fracturing began as an experiment in 1947, and the first commercially successful application followed in 1950. As of 2012, 2.5 million frac jobs had been performed worldwide on oil and gas wells; over one million of those within the U.S. Such treatment is generally necessary to achieve adequate flow rates in shale gas, tight gas, tight oil, and coal seam gas wells. Some hydraulic fractures can form naturally in certain veins or dikes.Hydraulic fracturing is highly controversial in many countries. Its proponents advocate the economic benefits of more extensively accessible hydrocarbons. However, opponents argue that these are out-weighed by the potential environmental impacts, which include risks of ground and surface water contamination, air and noise pollution, and potentially triggering earthquakes, along with the consequential hazards to public health and the environment.Increases in seismic activity following hydraulic fracturing along dormant or previously unknown faults are sometimes caused by the deep-injection disposal of hydraulic fracturing flowback (a byproduct of hydraulically fractured wells), and produced formation brine (a byproduct of both fractured and nonfractured oil and gas wells). For these reasons, hydraulic fracturing is under international scrutiny, restricted in some countries, and banned altogether in others. Some countries have banned the practice or put moratoria in place, while others have adopted an approach involving tight regulation. The European Union is drafting regulations that would permit controlled application of hydraulic fracturing.Mechanics.Fracturing rocks at great depth frequently becomes suppressed by pressure due to the weight of the overlying rock strata and the cementation of the formation. This suppression process is particularly significant in tensile (Mode 1) fractures which require the walls of the fracture to move against this pressure. Fracturing occurs when effective stress is overcome by the pressure of fluids within the rock. The minimum principal stress becomes tensile and exceeds the tensile strength of the material. Fractures formed in this way are generally oriented in a plane perpendicular to the minimum principal stress, and for this reason, hydraulic fractures in well bores can be used to determine the orientation of stresses. In natural examples, such as dikes or vein-filled fractures, the orientations can be used to infer past states of stress.Veins.Most mineral vein systems are a result of repeated natural fracturing during periods of relatively high pore fluid pressure. The impact of high pore fluid pressure on the formation process of mineral vein systems is particularly evident in crack-seal veins, where the vein material is part of a series of discrete fracturing events, and extra vein material is deposited on each occasion. One example of long-term repeated natural fracturing is in the effects of seismic activity. Stress levels rise and fall episodically, and earthquakes can cause large volumes of connate water to be expelled from fluid-filled fractures. This process is referred to as seismic pumping.Dikes.Minor intrusions in the upper part of the crust, such as dikes, propagate in the form of fluid-filled cracks. In such cases, the fluid is magma. In sedimentary rocks with a significant water content, fluid at fracture tip will be steam.Precursors.Fracturing as a method to stimulate shallow, hard rock oil wells dates back to the 1860s. Dynamite or nitroglycerin detonations were used to increase oil and natural gas production from petroleum bearing formations. On 25 April 1865, Civil War veteran Col. Edward A. L. Roberts received a patent for an exploding torpedo. It was employed in Pennsylvania, New York, Kentucky, and West Virginia using liquid and also, later, solidified nitroglycerin. Later still the same method was applied to water and gas wells. Stimulation of wells with acid, instead of explosive fluids, was introduced in the 1930s. Due to acid etching, fractures would not close completely resulting in further productivity increase.Oil and gas wells.The relationship between well performance and treatment pressures was studied by Floyd Farris of Stanolind Oil and Gas Corporation. This study was the basis of the first hydraulic fracturing experiment, conducted in 1947 at the Hugoton gas field in Grant County of southwestern Kansas by Stanolind. For the well treatment, of gelled gasoline (essentially napalm) and sand from the Arkansas River was injected into the gas-producing limestone formation at. The experiment was not very successful as deliverability of the well did not change appreciably. The process was further described by J.B. Clark of Stanolind in his paper published in 1948. A patent on this process was issued in 1949 and exclusive license was granted to the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company. On 17 March 1949, Halliburton performed the first two commercial hydraulic fracturing treatments in Stephens County, Oklahoma, and Archer County, Texas. Since then, hydraulic fracturing has been used to stimulate approximately one million oil and gas wells in various geologic regimes with good success.In contrast with large-scale hydraulic fracturing used in low-permeability formations, small hydraulic fracturing treatments are commonly used in high-permeability formations to remedy skin damage, a low-permeability zone that sometimes forms at the rock-borehole interface. In such cases the fracturing may extend only a few feet from the borehole.In the Soviet Union, the first hydraulic proppant fracturing was carried out in 1952. Other countries in Europe and Northern Africa subsequently employed hydraulic fracturing techniques including Norway, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Austria, France, Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Turkey, Tunisia, and Algeria.Massive fracturing.Massive hydraulic fracturing (also known as high-volume hydraulic fracturing) is a technique first applied by Pan American Petroleum in Stephens County, Oklahoma, USA in 1968. The definition of massive hydraulic fracturing varies, but generally refers to treatments injecting over 150 short tons, or approximately 300,000 pounds (136 metric tonnes), of proppant.American geologists gradually became aware that there were huge volumes of gas-saturated sandstones with permeability too low (generally less than 0.1 millidarcy) to recover the gas economically. Starting in 1973, massive hydraulic fracturing was used in thousands of gas wells in the San Juan Basin, Denver Basin, the Piceance Basin, and the Green River Basin, and in other hard rock formations of the western US. Other tight sandstone wells in the US made economically viable by massive hydraulic fracturing were in the Clinton-Medina Sandstone, and Cotton Valley Sandstone.Massive hydraulic fracturing quickly spread in the late 1970s to western Canada, Rotliegend and Carboniferous gas-bearing sandstones in Germany, Netherlands (onshore and offshore gas fields), and the United Kingdom in the North Sea.Horizontal oil or gas wells were unusual until the late 1980s. Then, operators in Texas began completing thousands of oil wells by drilling horizontally in the Austin Chalk, and giving massive slickwater hydraulic fracturing treatments to the wellbores. Horizontal wells proved much more effective than vertical wells in producing oil from tight chalk; sedimentary beds are usually nearly horizontal, so horizontal wells have much larger contact areas with the target formation.Shales.Hydraulic fracturing of shales goes back at least to 1965, when some operators in the Big Sandy gas field of eastern Kentucky and southern West Virginia started hydraulically fracturing the Ohio Shale and Cleveland Shale, using relatively small fracs. The frac jobs generally increased production, especially from lower-yielding wells.In 1976, the United States government started the Eastern Gas Shales Project, which included numerous public-private hydraulic fracturing demonstration projects. During the same period, the Gas Research Institute, a gas industry research consortium, received approval for research and funding from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.In 1997, taking the slickwater fracturing technique used in East Texas by Union Pacific Resources (now part of Anadarko Petroleum Corporation), Mitchell Energy (now part of Devon Energy), applied the technique in the Barnett Shale of north Texas. This made gas extraction widely economical in the Barnett Shale, and was later applied to other shales. George P. Mitchell has been called the father of fracking because of his role in applying it in shales. The first horizontal well in the Barnett Shale was drilled in 1991, but was not widely done in the Barnett until it was demonstrated that gas could be economically extracted from vertical wells in the Barnett.As of 2013, massive hydraulic fracturing is being applied on a commercial scale to shales in the United States, Canada, and China. Several additional countries are planning to use hydraulic fracturing.Process.According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), hydraulic fracturing is a process to stimulate a natural gas, oil, or geothermal well to maximize extraction. The EPA defines the broader process to include acquisition of source water, well construction, well stimulation, and waste disposal.Method.A hydraulic fracture is formed by pumping fracturing fluid into a wellbore at a rate sufficient to increase pressure at the target depth (determined by the location of the well casing perforations), to exceed that of the fracture gradient (pressure gradient) of the rock. The fracture gradient is defined as pressure increase per unit of depth relative to density, and is usually measured in pounds per square inch, per square foot, or bars. The rock cracks, and the fracture fluid permeates the rock extending the crack further, and further, and so on. Fractures are localized as pressure drops off with the rate of frictional loss, which is relevant to the distance from the well. Operators typically try to maintain fracture width, or slow its decline following treatment, by introducing a proppant into the injected fluida material such as grains of sand, ceramic, or other particulate, thus preventing the fractures from closing when injection is stopped and pressure removed. Consideration of proppant strength and prevention of proppant failure becomes more important at greater depths where pressure and stresses on fractures are higher. The propped fracture is permeable enough to allow the flow of gas, oil, salt water and hydraulic fracturing fluids to the well.During the process, fracturing fluid leakoff (loss of fracturing fluid from the fracture channel into the surrounding permeable rock) occurs. If not controlled, it can exceed 70% of the injected volume. This may result in formation matrix damage, adverse formation fluid interaction, and altered fracture geometry, thereby decreasing efficiency.The location of one or more fractures along the length of the borehole is strictly controlled by various methods that create or seal holes in the side of the wellbore. Hydraulic fracturing is performed in cased wellbores, and the zones to be fractured are accessed by perforating the casing at those locations.Hydraulic-fracturing equipment used in oil and natural gas fields usually consists of a slurry blender, one or more high-pressure, high-volume fracturing pumps (typically powerful triplex or quintuplex pumps) and a monitoring unit. Associated equipment includes fracturing tanks, one or more units for storage and handling of proppant, high-pressure treating iron, a chemical additive unit (used to accurately monitor chemical addition), low-pressure flexible hoses, and many gauges and meters for flow rate, fluid density, and treating pressure. Chemical additives are typically 0.5% percent of the total fluid volume. Fracturing equipment operates over a range of pressures and injection rates, and can reach up to and (100 barrels per minute).Well types.A distinction can be made between conventional, low-volume hydraulic fracturing, used to stimulate high-permeability reservoirs for a single well, and unconventional, high-volume hydraulic fracturing, used in the completion of tight gas and shale gas wells. High-volume hydraulic fracturing usually requires higher pressures than low-volume fracturing; the higher pressures are needed to push out larger volumes of fluid and proppant that extend farther from the borehole.Horizontal drilling involves wellbores with a terminal drillhole completed as a lateral that extends parallel with the rock layer containing the substance to be extracted. For example, laterals extend in the Barnett Shale basin in Texas, and up to in the Bakken formation in North Dakota. In contrast, a vertical well only accesses the thickness of the rock layer, typically. Horizontal drilling reduces surface disruptions as fewer wells are required to access the same volume of rock.Drilling often plugs up the pore spaces at the wellbore wall, reducing permeability at and near the wellbore. This reduces flow into the borehole from the surrounding rock formation, and partially seals off the borehole from the surrounding rock. Low-volume hydraulic fracturing can be used to restore permeability.Fracturing fluids.The main purposes of fracturing fluid are to extend fractures, add lubrication, change gel strength, and to carry proppant into the formation. There are two methods of transporting proppant in the fluidhigh-rate and high-viscosity. High-viscosity fracturing tends to cause large dominant fractures, while high-rate (slickwater) fracturing causes small spread-out micro-fractures.Water-soluble gelling agents (such as guar gum) increase viscosity and efficiently deliver proppant into the formation.Fluid is typically a slurry of water, proppant, and chemical additives. Additionally, gels, foams, and compressed gases, including nitrogen, carbon dioxide and air can be injected. Typically, 90% of the fluid is water and 9.5% is sand with chemical additives accounting to about 0.5%. However, fracturing fluids have been developed using liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and propane in which water is unnecessary.The proppant is a granular material that prevents the created fractures from closing after the fracturing treatment. Types of proppant include silica sand, resin-coated sand, bauxite, and man-made ceramics. The choice of proppant depends on the type of permeability or grain strength needed. In some formations, where the pressure is great enough to crush grains of natural silica sand, higher-strength proppants such as bauxite or ceramics may be used. The most commonly used proppant is silica sand, though proppants of uniform size and shape, such as a ceramic proppant, are believed to be more effective.The fracturing fluid varies depending on fracturing type desired, and the conditions of specific wells being fractured, and water characteristics. The fluid can be gel, foam, or slickwater-based. Fluid choices are tradeoffs: more viscous fluids, such as gels, are better at keeping proppant in suspension; while less-viscous and lower-friction fluids, such as slickwater, allow fluid to be pumped at higher rates, to create fractures farther out from the wellbore. Important material properties of the fluid include viscosity, pH, various rheological factors, and others.Water is mixed with sand and chemicals to create fracking fluid. Approximately 40,000 gallons of chemicals are used per fracturing.The most common chemical used for hydraulic fracturing in the United States in 20052009 was methanol, while some other most widely used chemicals were isopropyl alcohol, 2-butoxyethanol, and ethylene glycol.For slickwater fluids the use of sweeps is common. Sweeps are temporary reductions in the proppant concentration, which help ensure that the well is not overwhelmed with proppant. As the fracturing process proceeds, viscosity-reducing agents such as oxidizers and enzyme breakers are sometimes added to the fracturing fluid to deactivate the gelling agents and encourage flowback. Such oxidizer react with and break down the gel, reducing the fluid\'s viscosity and ensuring that no proppant is pulled from the formation. An enzyme acts as a catalyst for breaking down the gel. Sometimes pH modifiers are used to break down the crosslink at the end of a hydraulic fracturing job, since many require a pH buffer system to stay viscous. At the end of the job, the well is commonly flushed with water under pressure (sometimes blended with a friction reducing chemical.) Some (but not all) injected fluid is recovered. This fluid is managed by several methods, including underground injection control, treatment, discharge, recycling, and temporary storage in pits or containers. New technology is continually developing to better handle waste water and improve re-usability.Fracture monitoring.Measurements of the pressure and rate during the growth of a hydraulic fracture, with knowledge of fluid properties and proppant being injected into the well, provides the most common and simplest method of monitoring a hydraulic fracture treatment. This data along with knowledge of the underground geology can be used to model information such as length, width and conductivity of a propped fracture.Injection of radioactive tracers along with the fracturing fluid is sometimes used to determine the injection profile and location of created fractures. Radiotracers are selected to have the readily detectable radiation, appropriate chemical properties, and a half life and toxicity level that will minimize initial and residual contamination. Radioactive isotopes chemically bonded to glass (sand) and/or resin beads may also be injected to track fractures. For example, plastic pellets coated with 10 GBq of Ag-110mm may be added to the proppant, or sand may be labelled with Ir-192, so that the proppant\'s progress can be monitored. Radiotracers such as Tc-99m and I-131 are also used to measure flow rates. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission publishes guidelines which list a wide range of radioactive materials in solid, liquid and gaseous forms that may be used as tracers and limit the amount that may be used per injection and per well of each radionuclide.A new technique in well-monitoring involves fiber-optic cables outside the casing. Using the fiber optics, temperatures can be measured every foot along the well - even while the wells are being fracked and pumped. By monitoring the temperature of the well, engineers can determine how much fracking fluid different parts of the well use as well as how much natural gas they collect.Microseismic monitoring.For more advanced applications, microseismic monitoring is sometimes used to estimate the size and orientation of induced fractures. Microseismic activity is measured by placing an array of geophones in a nearby wellbore. By mapping the location of any small seismic events associated with the growing fracture, the approximate geometry of the fracture is inferred. Tiltmeter arrays deployed on the surface or down a well provide another technology for monitoring strainMicroseismic mapping is very similar geophysically to seismology. In earthquake seismology, seismometers scattered on or near the surface of the earth record S-waves and P-waves that are released during an earthquake event. This allows for motion along the fault plane to be estimated and its location in the earths subsurface mapped. Hydraulic fracturing, an increase in formation stress proportional to the net fracturing pressure, as well as an increase in pore pressure due to leakoff. Tensile stresses are generated ahead of the fracture\'s tip, generating large amounts of shear stress. The increases in pore water pressure and in formation stress combine and affect weaknesses near the hydraulic fracture, like natural fractures, joints, and bedding planes.Different methods have different location errors and advantages. Accuracy of microseismic event mapping is dependent on the signal-to-noise ratio and the distribution of sensors. Accuracy of events located by seismic inversion is improved by sensors placed in multiple azimuths from the monitored borehole. In a downhole array location, accuracy of events is improved by being close to the monitored borehole (high signal-to-noise ratio).Monitoring of microseismic events induced by reservoir stimulation has become a key aspect in evaluation of hydraulic fractures, and their optimization. The main goal of hydraulic fracture monitoring is to completely characterize the induced fracture structure, and distribution of conductivity within a formation. Geomechanical analysis, such as understanding a formations material properties, in-situ conditions, and geometries, helps monitoring by providing a better definition of the environment in which the fracture network propagates. The next task is to know the location of proppant within the fracture and the distribution of fracture conductivity. This can be monitored using multiple types of techniques to finally develop a reservoir model than accurately predicts well performance.Horizontal completions.Since the early 2000s, advances in drilling and completion technology have made horizontal wellbores much more economical. Horizontal wellbores allow far greater exposure to a formation than conventional vertical wellbores. This is particularly useful in shale formations which do not have sufficient permeability to produce economically with a vertical well. Such wells, when drilled onshore, are now usually hydraulically fractured in a number of stages, especially in North America. The type of wellbore completion is used to determine how many times a formation is fractured, and at what locations along the horizontal section.In North America, shale reservoirs such as the Bakken, Barnett, Montney, Haynesville, Marcellus, and most recently the Eagle Ford, Niobrara and Utica shales are drilled horizontally through the producing interval(s), completed and fractured. The method by which the fractures are placed along the wellbore is most commonly achieved by one of two methods, known as plug and perf and sliding sleeve.The wellbore for a plug-and-perf job is generally composed of standard steel casing, cemented or uncemented, set in the drilled hole. Once the drilling rig has been removed, a wireline truck is used to perforate near the bottom of the well, and then fracturing fluid is pumped. Then the wireline truck sets a plug in the well to temporarily seal off that section so the next section of the wellbore can be treated. Another stage is pumped, and the process is repeated along the horizontal length of the wellbore.The wellbore for the sliding sleeve technique is different in that the sliding sleeves are included at set spacings in the steel casing at the time it is set in place. The sliding sleeves are usually all closed at this time. When the well is due to be fractured, the bottom sliding sleeve is opened using one of several activation techniques and the first stage gets pumped. Once finished, the next sleeve is opened, concurrently isolating the previous stage, and the process repeats. For the sliding sleeve method, wireline is usually not required.These completion techniques may allow for more than 30 stages to be pumped into the horizontal section of a single well if required, which is far more than would typically be pumped into a vertical well that had far fewer feet of producing zone exposed.Uses.Hydraulic fracturing is used to increase the rate at which fluids, such as petroleum, water, or natural gas can be recovered from subterranean natural reservoirs. Reservoirs are typically porous sandstones, limestones or dolomite rocks, but also include unconventional reservoirs such as shale rock or coal beds. Hydraulic fracturing enables the extraction of natural gas and oil from rock formations deep below the earth\'s surface (generally), which is greatly below typical groundwater reservoir levels. At such depth, there may be insufficient permeability or reservoir pressure to allow natural gas and oil to flow from the rock into the wellbore at high economic return. Thus, creating conductive fractures in the rock is instrumental in extraction from naturally impermeable shale reservoirs. Permeability is measured in the microdarcy to nanodarcy range. Fractures are a conductive path connecting a larger volume of reservoir to the well. So-called super fracking, creates cracks deeper in the rock formation to release more oil and gas, and increases efficiency. The yield for typical shale bores generally falls off after the first year or two, but the peak producing life of a well can be extended to several decades.Since the late 1970s, hydraulic fracturing has been used, in some cases, to increase the yield of drinking water from wells in a number of countries, including the US, Australia, and South Africa.Economic effects.Hydraulic fracturing has been seen as one of the key methods of extracting unconventional oil and unconventional gas resources. According to the International Energy Agency, the remaining technically recoverable resources of shale gas are estimated to amount to, tight gas to, and coalbed methane to. As a rule, formations of these resources have lower permeability than conventional gas formations. Therefore, depending on the geological characteristics of the formation, specific technologies (such as hydraulic fracturing) are required. Although there are also other methods to extract these resources, such as conventional drilling or horizontal drilling, hydraulic fracturing is one of the key methods making their extraction economically viable. The multi-stage fracturing technique has facilitated the development of shale gas and light tight oil production in the United States and is believed to do so in the other countries with unconventional hydrocarbon resources.The National Petroleum Council estimates that hydraulic fracturing will eventually account for nearly 70% of natural gas development in North America. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling apply the latest technologies and make it commercially viable to recover shale gas and oil. In the United States, 45% of domestic natural gas production and 17% of oil production would be lost within 5 years without usage of hydraulic fracturing.U.S.-based refineries have gained a competitive edge with their access to relatively inexpensive shale oil and Canadian crude. The U.S. is exporting more refined petroleum products, and also more liquified petroleum gas (LP gas). LP gas is produced from hydrocarbons called natural gas liquids, released by the hydraulic fracturing of petroliferous shale, in a variety of shale gas that\'s relatively easy to export. Propane, for example, costs around $620 a ton in the U.S. compared with more than $1,000 a ton in China, as of early 2014. Japan, for instance, is importing extra LP gas to fuel power plants, replacing idled nuclear plants. Trafigura Beheer BV, the third-largest independent trader of crude oil and refined products, said at the start of 2014 that growth in U.S. shale production has turned the distillates market on its head.Some studies call into question the claim that what has been called the shale gas revolution has a significant macro-economic impact. A study released in the beginning of 2014 by the IDDRI concluded the contrary. It states that, on the long-term as well as on the short-run, the shale gas revolution due to hydraulic fracturing in the United States has had very little impact on economic growth and competitiveness. The same report concludes that in Europe, using hydraulic fracturing would have very little advantage in terms of competitiveness and energy security. Indeed, for the period 2030-2035, shale gas is estimated to cover 3 to 10% of EU projected energy demand, which is not enough to have a significant impact on energetic independence and competitiveness.Hydrofracked shale oil and gas has the potential to alter the geography of energy production in the US. In the short run, in counties with hydrofracturing employment in the oil and gas sector more than doubled in the last 10 years, with spill-overs in local transport-, construction but also manufacturing sectors. The manufacturing sector benefits from lower energy prices, giving the US manufacturing sector a competitive edge. On average, natural gas prices have decreased by more than 30% in counties above shale deposits compared to the rest of the US. Some research has highlighted the negative effects on house prices for properties in the direct vicinity of fracturing wells. Local house prices in Pennsylvania decrease if the property is close to a hydrofracking gas well and is not connected to city water, suggesting that the concerns of ground water pollution are priced by markets.Politics and public policy.An anti-fracking movement has emerged both internationally with involvement of international environmental organizations and nations such as France and locally in affected areas such as Balcombe in Sussex where the Balcombe drilling protest was in progress during mid-2013. The considerable opposition against hydraulic fracturing activities in local townships in the United States has led companies to adopt a variety of public relations measures to reassure the public, including the employment of former military personnel with training in psychological warfare operations. According to Matt Pitzarella, the communications director at Range Resources, employees trained in the Middle East have been valuable to Range Resources in Pennsylvania, when dealing with emotionally charged township meetings and advising townships on zoning and local ordinances dealing with hydraulic fracturing.Protests have occasionally been marred by acts of violence. In March 2013, ten people were arrested during an anti-fracking protest near New Matamoras, Ohio, after they illegally entered a development zone and latched themselves to drilling equipment. In northwest Pennsylvania, there was a drive-by shooting at a well site, in which someone shot two rounds of a small-caliber rifle in the direction of a drilling rig, before shouting profanities at the site and fleeing the scene. In Washington County, Pennsylvania, a contractor working on a gas pipeline found a pipe bomb that had been placed where a pipeline was to be constructed, which local authorities said would have caused a catastrophe had they not discovered and detonated it.In 2014 a number of European officials provided circumstantial evidence that Eastern European protests against fracking may be sponsored by Gazprom, Russia\'s state-controlled gas company. Russian officials have on numerous occasions warned Europe that fracking poses a huge environmental problem.Documentary films.Josh Fox\'s 2010 Academy Award nominated film Gasland became a center of opposition to hydraulic fracturing of shale. The movie presented problems with ground water contamination near well sites in Pennsylvania, Wyoming, and Colorado. Energy in Depth, an oil and gas industry lobbying group, called the film\'s facts into question. In response, a rebuttal of Energy in Depths claims of inaccuracy was posted on Gasland\'s website.The Director of the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission (COGCC) offered to be interviewed as part of the film if he could review what was included from the interview in the final film but Fox declined the offer. Exxon Mobil, Chevron Corporation and ConocoPhillips aired advertisements during 2011 and 2012 that claimed to describe the economic and environmental benefits of natural gas and argue that hydraulic fracturing was safe.The film Promised Land, starring Matt Damon, takes on hydraulic fracturing. The gas industry is making plans to try to counter the film\'s criticisms of hydraulic fracturing with informational flyers, and Twitter and Facebook posts.On 22 January 2013 Northern Irish journalist and filmmaker Phelim McAleer released a crowdfunded documentary called FrackNation as a response to the statements made by Fox in Gasland. FrackNation premiered on Mark Cuban\'s AXS TV. The premiere corresponded with the release of Promised Land.On 21 April 2013, Josh Fox released Gasland 2, a documentary that states that the gas industry\'s portrayal of natural gas as a clean and safe alternative to oil is a myth, and that hydraulically fractured wells inevitably leak over time, contaminating water and air, hurting families, and endangering the earth\'s climate with the potent greenhouse gas methane.In 2014, Vido Innovations released the documentary The Ethics of Fracking. The film covers the politics, spiritual, scientific, medical and professional points of view on hydraulic fracturing. It also digs into the way the gas industry portrays fracking in their advertising.In 2015, the Canadian documentary film Fractured Land had its world premiere at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.Research issues.Typically the funding source of the research studies is a focal point of controversy. Concerns have been raised about research funded by foundations and corporations, or by environmental groups, which can at times lead to at least the appearance of unreliable studies. Several organizations, researchers, and media outlets have reported difficulty in conducting and reporting the results of studies on hydraulic fracturing due to industry and governmental pressure, and expressed concern over possible censoring of environmental reports. There is a need for more research into the environmental and health effects of the technique.Health risks.There is concern over the possible adverse public health implications of hydraulic fracturing activity. A 2013 review on shale gas production in the United States stated, with increasing numbers of drilling sites, more people are at risk from accidents and exposure to harmful substances used at fractured wells. A 2011 hazard assessment recommended full disclosure of chemicals used for hydraulic fracturing and drilling as many have immediate health effects, and many may have long-term health effects.In June 2014 Public Health England published a review of the potential public health impacts of exposures to chemical and radioactive pollutants as a result of shale gas extraction in the UK, based on the examination of literature and data from countries where hydraulic fracturing already occurs. The executive summary of the report stated: An assessment of the currently available evidence indicates that the potential risks to public health from exposure to the emissions associated with shale gas extraction will be low if the operations are properly run and regulated. Most evidence suggests that contamination of groundwater, if it occurs, is most likely to be caused by leakage through the vertical borehole. Contamination of groundwater from the underground hydraulic fracturing process itself (ie the fracturing of the shale) is unlikely. However, surface spills of hydraulic fracturing fluids or wastewater may affect groundwater, and emissions to air also have the potential to impact on health. Where potential risks have been identified in the literature, the reported problems are typically a result of operational failure and a poor regulatory environment.A 2012 report prepared for the European Union Directorate-General for the Environment identified potential risks to humans from air pollution and ground water contamination posed by hydraulic fracturing. This led to a series of recommendations in 2014 to mitigate these concerns. A 2012 guidance for pediatric nurses in the US said that hydraulic fracturing had a potential negative impact on public health and that pediatric nurses should be prepared to gather information on such topics so as to advocate for improved community health.Environmental impacts.The environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing include air emissions and climate change, high water consumption, water contamination, land use, risk of earthquakes, noise pollution, and health effects on humans. Air emissions are primarily methane that escapes from wells, along with industrial emissions from equipment used in the extraction process. Modern UK and EU regulation requires zero emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Escape of methane is a bigger problem in older wells than in ones built under more recent EU legislation.Hydraulic fracturing uses between of water per well, with large projects using up to. Additional water is used when wells are refractured. An average well requires of water over its lifetime. According to the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, greater volumes of fracturing fluids are required in Europe, where the shale depths average 1.5 times greater than in the U.S. Surface water may be contaminated through spillage and improperly built and maintained waste pits, and ground water can be contaminated if the fluid is able to escape the formation being fractured (through, for example, abandoned wells) or by produced water (the returning fluids, which also contain dissolved constituents such as minerals and brine waters). Produced water is managed by underground injection, municipal and commercial wastewater treatment and discharge, selfcontained systems at well sites or fields, and recycling to fracture future wells. Typically less than half of the produced water used to fracture the formation is recovered.About of land is needed per each drill pad for surface installations. Well pad and supporting structure construction significantly fragments landscapes which likely has negative effects on wildlife. These sites need to be remediated after wells are exhausted. Each well pad (in average 10wells per pad) needs during preparatory and hydraulic fracturing process about 800 to 2,500days of noisy activity, which affect both residents and local wildlife. In addition, noise is created by continuous truck traffic (sand, etc.) needed in hydraulic fracturing. Research is underway to determine if human health has been affected by air and water pollution, and rigorous following of safety procedures and regulation is required to avoid harm and to manage the risk of accidents that could cause harm.In July 2013, the US Federal Railroad Administration listed oil contamination by hydraulic fracturing chemicals as a possible cause of corrosion in oil tank cars.Hydraulic fracturing sometimes causes induced seismicity or earthquakes. The magnitude of these events is usually too small to be detected at the surface, although tremors attributed to fluid injection into disposal wells have been large enough to have often been felt by people, and to have caused property damage and possibly injuries.Microseismic events are often used to map the horizontal and vertical extent of the fracturing. A better understanding of the geology of the area being fracked and used for injection wells can be helpful in mitigating the potential for significant seismic events.Regulations.Countries using or considering use of hydraulic fracturing have implemented different regulations, including developing federal and regional legislation, and local zoning limitations. In 2011, after public pressure France became the first nation to ban hydraulic fracturing, based on the precautionary principle as well as the principle of preventive and corrective action of environmental hazards. The ban was upheld by an October 2013 ruling of the Constitutional Council. Some other countries such as Scotland have placed a temporary moratorium on the practice due to public health concerns and strong public opposition. Countries like the United Kingdom and South Africa have lifted their bans, choosing to focus on regulation instead of outright prohibition. Germany has announced draft regulations that would allow using hydraulic fracturing for the exploitation of shale gas deposits with the exception of wetland areas. In China, regulation on shale gas still faces hurdles, as it has complex interrelations with other regulatory regimes, especially trade.The European Union has adopted a recommendation for minimum principles for using high-volume hydraulic fracturing. Its regulatory regime requires full disclosure of all additives. In the United States, the Ground Water Protection Council launched FracFocus.org, an online voluntary disclosure database for hydraulic fracturing fluids funded by oil and gas trade groups and the U.S. Department of Energy. Hydraulic fracturing is excluded from the Safe Drinking Water Act\'s underground injection control\'s regulation, except when diesel fuel is used. The EPA assures surveillance of the issuance of drilling permits when diesel fuel is employed.In 2012, Vermont became the first state in the United States to ban hydraulic fracturing. On 17 December 2014, New York became the second state to issue a complete ban on any hydraulic fracturing due to potential risks to human health and the environment.'),(35096155,'List_of_birds_of_the_Klamath_Basin','List of birds of the Klamath Basin.The following bird species are found in the Klamath Basin, Oregon, and related areas; (a few species listed are only native and have a larger continental range).

His father was also a royal justice. In about 1122 Basset married the eventual heiress of another other justice; the marriage settlement has survived. In 1129-30 Basset was co-sheriff of eleven counties. Basset and his wife founded a monastic house in 1125 from their lands, which before the donation were equivalent to 15 knight\'s fees.Early life.Basset was the son of Ralph Basset, who was a royal justice under Henry I. While it is not known whether Richard was Ralph\'s eldest son, Richard inherited Ralph\'s estates in Normandy, which were near Montreuil-au-Houlme. He also inherited his father\'s English estates at Colston Basset, Kingston Winslow, and Peatling Parva. The bulk of Ralph\'s English lands did not go to Richard, however. Basset\'s brother Nicholas signed over his own inheritance to Richard. Ralph Basset was considered one of the new men of Henry I. William Basset, the abbot of the Benedictine monastery of the abbey of St Benet of Hulme, may have been a relative, as he granted lands to Richard Basset in return for a 10 annual rent. Another relative may have been the Robert Basset who witnessed nine charters of Ranulf de Gernon, Earl of Chester.Royal service.In 1125, the king appointed Basset to oversee the lands of Peterborough Abbey after the death of the abbot. The revenues of a vacant abbey went to the king, and Basset\'s job was to secure Peterborough\'s income for King Henry.In 1129-30, Basset served as sheriff of Bedfordshire and Buckinghamshire, Cambridgeshire and Huntingdonshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Norfolk and Suffolk, and Surrey together with Aubrey de Vere II. The number of shrievalties was unusual, and is known from the Pipe Roll of 1130. According to the entries in the Pipe Roll, de Vere and Basset did not function as traditional sheriffs, farming the revenues, but were instead responsible for the entire royal revenue in those counties.As well as his service as a sheriff, Basset also served as a royal justice, hearing pleas in Leicestershire in 1129 and 1130. Between 1131 and 1133, Basset appears to have been a frequent attendee at the royal court, as he witnessed a number of documents. He was present at the councils held at Northampton in 1131 and at Westminster in 1132. Basset witnessed no royal documents after 1133, when King Henry left England for Normandy for the final time.After King Henry\'s death in 1135, Basset was not employed as a royal official, either as a justice or as a sheriff. He appears once as a witness to a charter of King Stephen\'s in 1136, but the authenticity of this document has been questioned. He had built a castle in Normandy at Montreuil-au-Houlme, but Basset did not have possession of it in 1136, when it was held against Stephen\'s opponents by William de Montpincon.Lands.Basset\'s lands did not form a compact estate, as they were spread over 11 counties. In 1135, Basset\'s lands totalled 184.25 carucates of land, and were later considered 15 knight\'s fees. In Leicestershire, Basset held most of the lands held by Robert de Buci at the time of the Domesday Survey of 1086. The lands were held by Basset of the king by right of his wife, but how the lands had passed into her family is unclear. In addition, Basset held land in Leicestershire from both King David I of Scotland and from Robert de Beaumont, the Earl of Leicester.In 1125, Basset and his wife founded an Augustinian Order priory at Launde in Leicestershire, This priory, Launde Priory, was endowed with the village of Loddington in Leicestershire and a number of churches in that county and others.Family and death.Basset married Matilda, the daughter and eventual heiress of Geoffrey Ridel (d. 1120), some time between 1120 and 1123. Matilda had a brother Robert, who was mentioned in her marriage settlement. By the terms of the settlement, Robert Ridel was placed under the guardianship of Richard Basset until he was knighted and married to Basset\'s niece. The marriage settlement describes Matilda\'s dowry as being worth four knight\'s fees. Basset also received the right to arrange marriages for Matilda\'s sisters. Robert\'s lands were to come to Basset if Robert had no children. Not long after the settlement was written, Basset was in possession of the lands that should have been Robert\'s.Basset witnessed a royal charter in 1135 but was dead by 1144, when his lands were granted by the Empress Matilda and her son Henry to Richard\'s son Geoffrey Ridel. His other sons were Ralph Basset, who held lands near Drayton, and William Basset, who held lands near Sapcote. William became a royal justice and sheriff like his father. Richard also had two daughters: Sibil, who married Robert de Cauz, and Matilda, who married John de Stuteville. Ralph inherited the ancestral lands in Normandy. The Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis wrote that Basset built a tower on his ancestral lands of Montreuil in Normandy purely to demonstrate his status and wealth.Ralph inherited the ancestral lands in Normandy.

Stretching for 7,000km (4,300mi) long, the region encompasses mountainous, tropical and desert environments. This colonisation and habitation of the region has been affected by its unique geography and climate, leading to the development of unique cultural and societal organisation. Study of the history of the Andean region began in the 20th century, involving both historical and archaeological investigation.After the first humans  who were then arranged into hunter-gatherer tribal groups  arrived in South America via the Isthmus of Panama, they spread out across the continent, with the earliest evidence for settlement in the Andean region dating to circa 15,000 BCE, in what archaeologists call the Lithic Period. In the ensuing Pre-Ceramic Period, plants began to be widely cultivated, and distinct religious centres emerged, such as the Kotosh Religious Tradition in the highlands.This was followed by the Initial Period. Various complex societies developed at this time, most notably the Chavn culture and the Moche civilisation. In later periods, much of the Andean region was conquered by the indigenous Incan tribe, who founded the largest empire that the Americas had ever seen, named Tahuantinsuyu. The Inca governed their empire from the capital city of Cuzco, administering it along traditional Andean lines.In the 16th century, Spanish colonisers from Europe arrived in the Andes, eventually subjugating the indigenous kingdoms and incorporating the Andean region into the Spanish Empire. In the 19th century, a rising tide of anti-imperialist nationalism that was sweeping all of South America led rebel armies to overthrow Spanish rule.The Andean region was subsequently divided into a number of new states, Peru, Chile, Bolivia and Ecuador.The 20th century saw the growing influence of the United States of America in the region, which was increasingly exploited for its natural gas supplies. This in turn led to the rise of a number of anti-imperialist and socialist movements to oppose U.S. and multinational involvement in Andean South America.Lithic Period: c.15,000 BCE3000 BCE.The earliest period in which humans inhabited the Andean region was the Lithic period, sometimes alternately called the Early Archaic period. It was a period characterised by the use of stone tools, or lithics, as the main form of technology, and a hunter-gatherer mode of existence.First colonisation.After the evolution of anatomically modern humans in eastern Africa circa 200,000 years ago, our species spread across the African continent and into Europe and Asia. It was from the Bering land bridge between Siberia in north-eastern Asia and Alaska in north-western North America that humans first crossed into the Americas. From there, vanguards of human groups headed south, colonising the rest of the continent before reaching the Isthmus of Panama and crossing into the continent of South America. Although there had been four biologically distinct genetic human populations in North America, as has been identified by DNA analysis, only one of these populations, that known as the Paleo-Indians, pushed as far south as Mesoamerica and South America, meaning that the indigenous inhabitants of that latter continent were genetically homogenous.Comparative analysis of indigenous religious beliefs across South America have led academics to suspect that the first Paleo-Indian colonists of the continent would have believed in a multi-layered universe in which the earth was suspended between a celestial outer sphere and a cavernous inner sphere. There would have been strong taboos against incest, something that would have prevented inbreeding (a particular problem amongst the genetic homogeneity of the Indigenous South Americans), and instead marriage was controlled by social conventions, such as the development of moiety systems of societal duality.The first pioneers in South America, migrating down south from the Isthmus of Panama, would likely have avoided the largely mountainous Andean region, because the upper Cordillera was glaciated, cold and sparsely vegetated, making life there difficult, whilst these early populations would have suffered from hypoxia. Instead, the early hunter-gatherer pioneers would have most likely stuck to the margins of the continent, where they could exploit the resources in the rivers, deltas and salt-water lagoons. Gradually, generation by generation, as the population grew, these Indigenous Americans spread out throughout the continent, with some groups eventually reaching the Andean region. They would have most likely initially inhabited the coastal lowland areas, only travelling up into the mountains to obtain resources like obsidian. Gradually, as their descendents became acclimatised to the altitude, groups of humans began to move up and inhabit higher points of the Andes.One of the earliest known Andean sites that have been properly investigated by archaeologists is that at Monte Verde in southern Chile, which has been radiocarbon dated to 14,800 years ago. At this site, there was evidence for seasonal settlement along the sandy banks of a creek in the sub-arctic pine forests of the low southern Cordillera, at which were found preserved wooden and stone tools, remnants of wild vegetables such as potatoes, and the skeletal remains of five or six mastodons which had been scavenged or hunted by the human occupants. Other Lithic period sites that have been discovered in the Andean region include Los Toldos, Taguatagua and Quero, all in contemporary Chile, and Pikimachay, Jaywamachay, Huarago and Uschumachay in contemporary Peru; from the evidence unearthed at these sites it is apparent that at this time, horse was most commonly hunted species, although sloth and guanaco were also apparent.Lithic adaptation.Due to the varied geographical areas in the Andean region, unique communities evolved to suit their own particular locations across the region in the latter part of the Lithic period. Archaeologists have defined these different communities by their unique types of stone tool designs, describing them as the Northwestern tradition, the coastal Paijan tradition, the Central Andean Lithic Tradition, and the Atacama Maritime Tradition.It was also in this period that Andean communities first began to domesticate crops, genetically transforming various plant species from their wild counterparts.Pre-Ceramic Period: c.3000 BCEc.2000 BCE.The Lithic Period was followed by what archaeologists have called the Pre-Ceramic Period, or alternatively the Late Archaic Period, and is characterised by increasing societal complexity, rising population levels and the construction of monumental ceremonial centres across the Andean region. It is the latter of these features that remains the most visually obvious characteristic of the Pre-Ceramic amongst archaeologists, and indicates that by this time, Andean society was sufficiently developed that it could organise large building projects involving the management of labor. The Pre-Ceramic Period also saw a rise in the population of the Andean region, with the possibility that many people were partially migratory, spending much of their year in rural areas but moving to the monumental ceremonial centers for certain times which were seen as having special significance. The Pre-Ceramic also saw climate change occurring in the Andean region, for the culmination of the Ice Age had led to an end of the glacial meltback which had been occurring throughout the Lithic Period, and as a result the sea levels on the west coast of South America stabilized.Despite these changes, many elements of Andean society remained the same as it had been in earlier millennia; for instance, as its name suggests, the Pre-Ceramic was also a period when Andean society had yet to develop ceramic technology, and therefore had no pottery to use for cooking or storage. Similarly, Andean communities in the Pre-Ceramic had not developed agriculture or domesticated flora or fauna, instead gaining most of their food from what they could hunt or gather from the wild, just as their Lithic Period predecessors had done, although there is evidence that some wild plants had begun to be intentionally cultivated.Ceremonial monuments.In the mountain drainage areas of the Andes, a series of ceremonial buildings were constructed that archaeologists have identified as being a part of what they called the Kotosh Religious Tradition. One of the most prominent of these sites was that at Kotosh, after which the religious tradition was named. Located on the bank of the Ro Higueras, Kotosh was at an elevation of c. 2000 metres above sea level, and consisted of two large platform mounds flanked by lesser constructions and a number of small structures on a nearby river terrace. Another notable example of the Kotosh Religious Tradition can be seen at La Galgada in the Callejn de Huaylas, modern Peru, which again consists of two platform mounds and several surrounding structures.In other parts of the Andean region, other traditions of ceremonial monument building also developed during the Pre-Ceramic period.Initial Period: c.2000 BCE0 CE.The development of ceramic technology in the Andean region, and the subsequent production of pottery for both cooking and storage, marks the beginning of what archaeologists call the Initial Period. The introduction of pottery was however simply one part of a much larger socioeconomic transformation along the Andean coast, as communities ceased seeing their coastal settlements as the major centers of activity in favour of more inland locations, and as such the former maritime-based economy was replaced by one that was dominated by irrigation farming.Tahuantinsuyu.It was in the Intermediate Period that an empire rose up across the entire stretch of the Andes which was called Tahuantinsuyu, meaning The Four Regions in the Quechua language.Although drawing heavily upon the technological and organizational accomplishments of earlier Andean cultures, the Incan rulers refused to accept these antecedents, instead claiming that prior to the rise of Tahuantinsuyu, the Andes had merely been inhabited by primitive warlike tribes that the Incan tribe unified under their own civilising influence.European colonisation: 16th to 19th centuries.The Andean region became a part of the Spanish Empire.Wars of Independence.A key figure in these wars were Simn Bolvar; in gratitiude the nation of Bolivia adopted its name after him.Post-war development.In 1969, five Andean states  Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru  founded their own trade bloc, the Andean Pact, and in 1973 were joined by Venezuela. In 1976, Chile then withdrew after Chilean President Augusto Pinochet declared the Pact incompatible with his right wing views. The Pact was renamed the Andean Community of Nations in 1996.The Pink Tide.In the 21st century, leftist presidents were elected to power in several Andean states, as a part of the wider pink tide then sweeping Latin America, in which the political left gained increasing power as a reaction against neoliberalism and the Washington Consensus. In 2006, Evo Morales of the Movement for Socialism party was elected to the presidency in Bolivia, whilst later that year Rafael Correa of the PAIS Alliance was elected in Ecuador; both Morales and Correa were socialists, nationalising industry and opposing U.S. and corporate influence in their respective nations. Instead, both allied themselves with the government of Venezuela, then led by Hugo Chvez and his United Socialist Party of Venezuela, and joined the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas, a trade bloc between Latin America\'s socialist nations.'),(3737211,'Ted_Quinlan','Ted Quinlan.Edward Andrew John Ted Quinlan AM (born 7 August 1942) is a former Australian politician.

Together, these viruses have been documented infecting over eight hundred different plant species from 82 different families.Genome.This virus has a single stranded RNA genome with negative polarity, therefore it is classified as a Class V virus ((-)ssRNA viruses). The structure of the genome resembles that of the genus Phlebovirus. The genome is linear and is 17.2 kb in size. It is segmented into three segments termed S (2.9kb), M (5.4kb) and L (8.9kb). The M and S RNA segments encode for proteins in an ambisense orientation.Transmission.Tospoviruses are arboviruses usually vectored by a thrips. At least ten species of thrips belonging to family Thripidae have been confirmed as vectors for the transmission of thirteen or more tospoviruses. The thrips vectors are not closely related, implying an independent origin of infection for each thrips, possibly transmitted horizontally through shared hosts. There may be other species of thrips competent to transmit similar viruses, but they have not been documented on crops of economic significance.Recent research concludes that thrips can only be infected by tospovirus during the larval phases of development, as pupation and metamorphosis separate the connection between the salivary glands and the infected muscle tissue of the mid-gut. Adults transmit the virus from infected salivary glands, and uninfected adults will not transmit the virus. Obviously, controlling the infection by limiting transmission from infected plants to larval thrips or by preventing adult dispersal from infected plants are key strategies in preventing an epidemic of the disease.Agricultural importance.Infection with the virus results in spotting and wilting of the plant, reduced vegetative output, and eventually death. No antiviral cures have been developed for plants infected with a Tospovirus, and infected plants should be removed from a field and destroyed in order to prevent the spread of the disease.There are a large number of plant families that are known to be affected by viruses of the Tospovirus genus. These include both food crops (such as peanuts, watermelons, capsicums, tomatoes, zucchinis, et al.) as well as ornamental species which are important to flower farms (calla lily, impatiens, crysanthemums, iris, et al.). For a more complete list of hosts examine the Tospovirus host list at Kansas State University.Diagnosis.Early symptoms of infection are difficult to diagnose. In young infected plants the characteristic symptoms consist of inward cupping of leaves and leaves that develop a bronze cast followed by dark spots. As the infection progresses additional symptoms develop which include dark streaks on the main stem and wilting of the top portion of the plant. Fruit may be deformed, show uneven ripening and often have raised bumps on the surface. Once a plant becomes infected the disease cannot be controlled.Serological and molecular tests are commercially available to diagnose TSWV as well as a second common tospovirus found in ornamentals, Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV). Cytological studies of TSWV and INSV have shown that these viruses produce granular inclusions in the cytoplasm of infected plants. These inclusions can be seen in the light microscope with proper staining techniques. These inclusions can be diagnostic.Epidemology.TSWV is prevalent in warm climates in regions with a high population of thrips. This virus is an agricultural pest in Asia, America, Europe and Africa. Over the past 15 years outbreaks of Tomato spotted wilt disease have become more prevalent in these regions. Therefore TSWV is described as an emerging viral disease of plants. The increased prevalence is largely because of the successful survival of the thrips vector Frankliniella occidentalis. Another thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis, has also been implicated in the transmission of at least three tospoviruses, but there remains some controversy over its efficiency as a vector. Immunological testing and vector-competence studies suggest that S. dorsalis may represents a non-transmitting carrier for some strains of virus.The success of this virus has also been attributed to the acquisition of a gene in the M segment of the genome which encodes a movement protein. This protein allows the virus to infect a wide range of hosts. The gene encoding this protein was likely acquired by recombination from either a plant host or from another plant virus.Management.Control of this disease is difficult. One of the reasons for this is that the wide host range allows the virus to successfully overseason from one crop to the next. To prevent spread of the virus infected plants should be immediately removed away from neighbouring plants. Control of insects, especially thrips, is important to reduce spread of the virus by vectors.'),(6301341,'Colina%2C_Chile','Colina, Chile.Colina is a Chilean city and commune, capital of the Chacabuco Province, in the northern part of the Santiago Metropolitan Region.Demographics.According to the 2002 census of the National Statistics Institute, Colina spans an area of and has 77,815 inhabitants (41,004 men and 36,811 women).

John Bannerman always treasured his Highland heritage and was a native Gaelic speaker. Bannerman was educated at Shawlands Academy and Glasgow High School. He graduated from the University of Glasgow with a Bachelor of Science and then went on to Balliol College, Oxford and later to Cornell University in the United States. In 1931 he married Ray Mundell and they had two sons and two daughters. One of their daughters was the Liberal Democrat MP, Ray Michie (later Baroness Michie of Gallanach). The historian John Bannerman was his son, and David Shade Munro, the rugby player and coach was his grandson.Rugby union.Bannerman started playing rugby union while at school, and between 191920, he was captain of Glasgow High School\'s 1st XV.Bannerman was an accomplished sportsman winning a rugby blue at Oxford and 37 caps for Scotland between 1921 and 1929.He went on to become Glasgow HSFP\'s most capped player.In 1954-55, Bannerman served as President of the Scottish Rugby Union.Career.In 1930, Bannerman was appointed as a farm manager on land owned by the Duke of Montrose. In 1952 Bannerman left the Montrose estate to become a farmer in his own interests and also that year became an Officer of the Order of the British Empire for services to the Festival of Britain.Politics.Bannerman became active in Liberal politics from the 1930s. He was particularly interested in the problems of depopulation and unemployment for ordinary people in the Scottish Highlands and islands. From 1942 to 1957 he was a Forestry Commissioner. In 1938 he was adopted as prospective Liberal parliamentary candidate for Argyll. When the seat fell vacant in 1940 it was mooted that Bannerman might run as a Liberal National but the negotiations with the Conservatives broke down robbing him of his best chance of entering the House of Commons. He contested Argyll unsuccessfully in the 1945 general election and Inverness in 1950. But in 1954 he was the candidate in an extraordinary by-election at Inverness which some historians have seen as a true turning point in Liberal fortunes in Scotland and perhaps the United Kingdom. From a position where there had been no Liberal candidate in the 1951 election, Bannerman jumped into second place over Labour, coming just 1331 votes behind the Tory winner. This was the best Liberal by-election performance since the war. At the general election of 1955, Bannerman came even closer, losing by just 966 votes. Although his vote share declined in the 1959 general election, the ground had been laid for a successful attack on the seat in the 1964 general election by Russell Johnston, who held the seat until he retired from the Commons in 1997.Bannerman was chairman of the Scottish Liberal Party from 1954 to 1964 and Rector of Aberdeen University in 1957. He made other attempts to enter the Commons, including giving Labour a close run at the Paisley by-election of 1961, registering a swing of 18.8% in a seat where there had been no Liberal candidate at the 1959 general election. He tried again without success at Paisley at the 1964 general election but in December 1967 he was made Baron Bannerman of Kildonan, of Kildonan in the County of Sutherland, and so finally entered Parliament.Life peerage.Bannerman was one of three Liberals to be made life peers at this time. The others were Tim Beaumont and John Foot. Their appointments were attacked by the Young Liberals as undemocratic. One particular critic was Tony Greaves, then editor of the Young Liberal publication Gunfire who argued that as the Liberal Party was in favour of a new social and political order, it was quite wrong to participate in the most pathetic feature of the existing order, the House of Lords. Greaves became Baron Greaves of Pendle in 2000.In his maiden speech in the Lords, Bannerman took up the Scottish cause referring to the anger of Hamilton where the Scottish National Party had just won a parliamentary by-election and warning it was the anger of two centuries in which the Scots had been what he described as a sleeping partner in the United Kingdom political scene.He died in Tidworth, Hampshire, on 10 May 1969 aged 67.'),(28817060,'Speakers_Going_Hammer','Speakers Going Hammer.Speakers Going Hammer is the third official single from The DeAndre Way by American rapper Soulja Boy.

It is currently the highest point in the city, above sea level. The castle currently stands in ruins.The High Castle is located in close proximity of the historic centre of Lviv (), formerly being surrounded by a fortification wall. The Castle Hill took its name from the High Castle (as opposite to the other, Low Castle), which used to be located on the hill from the 13th century to the late 19th century. The castle was a main defensive fort of the city during its existence.As it follows from Rus\' Chronicles, the first fortifying structures appeared on the Castle Hill in the time Halych-Volhynia, and were built by Leo I of Halych from wood. It was originally a wood and soil construction, as most others at that time. In 1259 by a request of Burunday Khan they were destroyed, but in 1270 were rebuilt. In 1340, when Lviv was captured by Casimir III of Poland the wooden castle was put under fire. In 1353 it was destroyed again by Lithuanians. A new brick castle appeared on the hill in 1362 by the king Casmimir III. It became the residence of Polish nobles.The castle was rebuilt and repaired many times. In the times of Khmelnytsky Uprising it was taken by Cossack forces of Colonel Maksym Kryvonis in October 1648. In 1704, when Lviv was occupied by Swedes the castle was heavily damaged. In 1777, Austrians initiated disassembling of fortifications around the castle.In the 19th century, the then destroyed castle was taken apart and new items were built in its place. The fortification was strengthened, trees were planted on the hill\'s slope, and a park was constructed. On the place where the castle once stood, a Union of Lublin Mound was constructed in 1869, dedicated to the 300-years of the Union of Lublin. Currently, an observation platform is located atop the kurgan. In 1957, a 141-meter tall television tower was constructed on top of the hill ().In 2004-2005, there were talks of reconstructing a stone castle on the hill. The project gained some support and opposition. However, at this time, plans for the construction of the castle are not realistic.'),(26842790,'Kari_Diesen','Kari Diesen.Kari Diesen (ne Heide-Steen; 24 June 1914  18 March 1987) was a Norwegian singer and revue actress.

The album was recorded between 2011 and 2012 and was driven after the moderate success of their third album, Hands All Over (2010), and later by the enormous success of the re-released edition, which was promoted by the single Moves like Jagger, recorded as a collaboration with Christina Aguilera. It is the band\'s only album not to feature keyboardist, rhythm guitarist and background vocalist, Jesse Carmichael, who took a temporary break from performing with the group to focus on his studies back then, but eventually returned to Maroon 5 in 2014. The band worked with different producers, such as Max Martin, who serves as the album\'s executive producer, Ryan Tedder, Shellback and Benny Blanco. The band\'s guitarist and Levine\'s usual co-writer James Valentine only has four credits on the album.The accompanying artwork, created by LA artist Young & Sick, is a colorful collage of illustrations seemingly inspired by the likes of Picasso and a range of modern cartoonists. Its title is a smirking allusion to Levine\'s ubiquity, while its sound is a reflection of how the group wishes to retain the large audience they won once again with Moves Like Jagger. The album\'s lead single Payphone, featuring rapper Wiz Khalifa, produced by Shellback and Benny Blanco, was released and performed on The Voice on April 16, 2012. The song was a success, reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, as well as on the ARIA Charts, while it topped the UK Singles Chart, Canadian Hot 100 and Italian Singles Chart. The second single, One More Night, was released on June 19, 2012. The song topped the Billboard Hot 100 for nine weeks, becoming their longest Hot 100 reign. All four singles released from Overexposed have reached the Hot 100 top-ten, including the last two of them: Daylight and Love Somebody.The album received a mixed reception from music critics. Some praised the album, calling it their strongest effort, but others criticized the direction the band decided to take, calling it a failed attempt to go mainstream. Additionally, critics and fans alike perceived the album as overly focused on Levine. It debuted at number 2 on the UK Albums Chart, selling 38,000 copies, and on the US Billboard 200 chart, selling 222,000 copies. According to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), Overexposed was the 10th global best-selling album of 2012 with sales of 2.2 million copies,and sold approximately 3 million copies due to 2013. To promote the album, the band started the Overexposed Tour, which lasted from 2012 to 2014.Background.It would be nice to start working on another record next year. I think with the last two records, it\'s been a little bit unbalanced, in that we had so much success and there was so much of the world to cover that our studio/road balance was a little off... In a perfect world we\'d tour for six months and maybe record for six months, but that\'s not the way it works. But the whole point is to make more music, and if anything you can spend too much time out there.Valentine also said the band has tons of material available, including holdovers including songs from Hands All Over and also other tracks the band has written since then. I think everybody\'s been pretty busy compiling ideas for the next one, he stated. With technology and the recording capacity we have on our laptops, we can be a little more prolific while we\'re [touring]. We\'ve never been able to do that before. I think we could go in and make a record today and have a pretty solid album. In July 2011, the band re-released Hands All Over and included a new song called Moves like Jagger which featured American recording artist Christina Aguilera. The song enjoyed a massive commercial success reaching number one on over 22 national singles chart including on the US Billboard Hot 100. In an interview with Mike Wood of Los Angeles Times, Levine explained what went wrong on Hands All Over, I don\'t think we knew what kind of record we were making. It was such a hodgepodge  all these disparate ideas and songs that didn\'t make any sense together. He also stated, We were in this idyllic paradise, which is a horrible place to make a record. Switzerland\'s neutrality is very famous, and I feel like that neutrality infected Maroon 5\'s third album. Levine further stated that Moves like Jagger saved them and totally revived the group.Recording and production.The band started writing songs for Overexposed during their latest tour in support of Hands All Over. After concluding with the tour, the band recorded the material of the album at the Conway Recording Studios located in Los Angeles, California. On March 22, 2012, the band posted a video on YouTube featuring numerous scenes from the band in the studio, recording the album. Speaking about the development on the material, Valentine revealed that Moves Like Jagger was the first time the band worked with an outside writer, so they decided to implement it more on Overexposed. At this point in our career I think it was a good thing to completely mix up our process and it yielded good results, as well as a more collaborative spirit within the band. We wanted to make something that sounded contemporary with the elements of a lot of early eras of pop music explained Valentine. On the development of the album, Levine also commented, Overexposed is definitely our most diverse and poppiest album yet. We had a great time recording it. I can\'t wait for our fans to hear the record, as well as hitting the road to play it live for everyone later this year. In another interview for Rolling Stone, the singer revealed that is their most dance-driven album ever, commenting: It\'s very much an old-fashioned disco tune. I have a love/hate relationship with it  but mostly I love it.The album was executively produced by Max Martin, with additional tracks produced by Benny Blanco and Ryan Tedder. Tedder commented that the sound of the songs is very fresh and it\'s gonna have an impact on kids. However, he further stated, maintaining that interest  that\'s the hardest thing in the world. Blanco explained that he and Levine first met during recording the song Stereo Hearts by Gym Class Heroes on which Levine is featured. The producer explained that when Levine heard the song he solely wanted in for himself on which Blanco responded that they will make another track for the band. After producing Moves Like Jagger, he also worked on Overexposed and produced some songs including the lead single of the album, Payphone. Although new collaborators were recruited to help developing the album, Levine wrote all the songs with additional help from Valentine and produced a large portion of it, including the ballad Sad. According to Valentine, the development of the song began one morning, when he woke up and before he was even awake he was at his living room\'s piano playing the melody. For an interview with MTV News, Levine told that Sad is his most personal track on the album, but didn\'t reveal the inspiration behind it, although critics speculated it was inspired by the singer\'s break up with Victoria\'s Secret model Anne Vyalitsyna.Influence and sound.Overexposed is a pop and pop rock album with dance-pop, electropop, R&B and reggae influences. According to the band\'s official website, the album is a chock-full collection of undeniable, anthemic melodies. Multiple critics stated that Moves like Jagger served as the biggest influence for composing and writing most songs on Overexposed. Additionally, they noted that the works by Barbadian recording artist Rihanna influenced the album\'s sound.Songs and lyrics.The album\'s opening track, One More Night, is an irresistible sexy reggae jam that features influences of pop and rock music. Lyrically, the storyline follows or being able to untangle from the particular love interest. The second track on the album, Payphone is a pop and R&B song that contains hip hop beats and piano hooks. Featuring a verse by American rapper Wiz Khalifa, the song explores the way a relationship used to be in the past. Daylight is a soft rock song, that carries influence from the works of English band Coldplay. According to Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly, the song has choruses that are thickly produced and the only physical instrument that you can pick is Levine\'s larynx. Lucky Strike is a funk song that features dubstep and soul rock influences and lyrically discovers the theme of sexual intercourse. The fifth track on the album, The Man Who Never Lied, produced by Brian West, is a pop and pop rock song that finds the protagonist in a relationship trouble where he is playing the role of a good person. According to Nate Chinen of The New York Times, in the song, Levine sings about spoiling his perfect record of honesty to spare a quarreling lover some hurtful feelings. Love Somebody is the sixth track on the album; a dance-pop song it contains a Sly Stone-meets-Eurythmics synth hook. The funk-laden seventh song, Ladykiller features a guitar solo and an elastic funk groove, combined with Adam Levine\'s blue-eyed soul vocal and pleasing echoes of Hall & Oates. It was inspired by the work of American recording artist Michael Jackson, as noted by the reviewers of BBC Music and Virgin Media.The eighth song on the album, Fortune Teller has a pop tempo piano beat, that meshes with the song to provide a mix of emotions. The song gives a sort of I want you, but I can\'t decide for you feel. Sad is a piano ballad, which highlights Levine\'s soulful tone that his voice possesses. Nick Levine of NME labeled the song as an Adele-apeing weepie. Lyrically, Sad is a song on which Levine achingly declares the end of his relationship and his heartbreak. The tenth track Tickets features twisting production that comes through as a tight, techno-influenced pop song. According to a reviewer of Billboard, the song is reminiscent of Maroon 5\'s 2010 single Give a Little More and it has lyrics about someone being a snob. Doin\' Dirt is a high-energy, beat-driven song, and a a revved, funky club cut. Its verses talk about horndog rhapsodies, with lyrics such as: I light you up when I get inside. The final track on the album, Beautiful Goodbye was described as a rhythmic ballad. It\'s an acoustic ode that\'s bittersweet, but at the same time positive. Additional three tracks are present on the deluxe edition of Overexposed, including Wipe Your Eyes, Wasted Years and Kiss, a cover of the 1986 single by Prince. Wipe Your Eyes is a mid-tempo piano-driven ballad that contains a sample of the recording Sabali by the Mali musical duo Amadou & Mariam.Artwork.On April 10, 2012, the band debuted the artwork of the album on their official website. Created by the LA based art project Young & Sick, the cover art doesn\'t feature any images of Maroon 5 and is instead a colorful collage of illustrations seemingly inspired by the likes of Picasso and a range of modern cartoonists. According to Natalie Finn from E! News, the psychedelic Beatles-dipped-in-Cream cover is a where-do-you-look-first wink at the pop-music world, which is so crowded with egos and images these days that it becomes almost impossible to just focus on the music. Allison of MuchMusic described the artwork as a combination of the 1967 album Sgt. Pepper\'s Lonely Hearts Club Band by The Beatles and illustrations of American show The Simpsons. The reviewer further noted that this is second time the band uses similar illustration the first one being on their 2002 debut album Songs About Jane. Jessica Sager from Pop Crush wrote, the bright colors and cartoon images are representative of the album\'s themes. Similarly, Rebecca Francois of Global Grind wrote that the artwork is like Maroon 5\'s music fun and pop. Becky Bain of website Idolator, negatively reviewed the cover and wrote that it is what an episode of The Simpsons looks like if you\'re on acid.Singles.Payphone featuring Wiz Khalifa, was released as the lead single from the album on April 17, 2012. The song was received generally positive reviews from critics, they noted departure from older Maroon 5 songs. However, some them were praised of the music direction where the band has taken. Magazine Rolling Stone placed Payphone at number 46 on their list of 50 Best Songs of 2012. Commercially, the song reached number one on over eight national singles charts and peaked within the top-ten on 20 additional charts. Payphone reached number two on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the UK Singles Chart. It was the fifth best selling single of 2012 with over 9.1 million digital copies sold worldwide. The music video of the song was directed by Samuel Bayer and features Levine being mistaken for a bank robber and fighting a fleet of policemen.One More Night was released as the second single from the album on June 19, 2012. The song received generally positive reviews from critics who praised the catchy reggae-drenched musical production and Adam Levine\'s confident pop vocals. One More Night reached the top-ten on over 26 national charts worldwide. It topped the US Billboard Hot 100 for nine consecutive weeks becoming Maroon 5\'s longest topping single on the chart and was tied with Call Me Maybe by Carly Rae Jepsen for longest lead of the year. The music video of One More Night premiered on June 25, 2012 on MTV and was directed by Peter Berg. The video features Levine\'s character being a boxer whose relationship is in ruins because of his profession, his love interest is played by American actress Minka Kelly.Daylight was released as the third single from the album on November 27, 2012. The song received generally mixed reviews from critics with Cameron Adams of Herald Sun noting that it sounds like Max Martin trying to write a Coldplay song by recycling his Backstreet Boys handiwork. Daylight reached the top-ten on over eight national charts worldwide including number seven on the US Billboard Hot 100 and number five on the Canadian Hot 100. Two music videos of the song are released: The first video The Daylight Project, features hundred of fans and the people from around the world are connected to the song and the video was directed by Jonas kerlund. The second video Playing for Change, includes several street musicians from around the world playing and sing along with the band on tour.Love Somebody was released as the fourth and final single from the album on May 14, 2013.

The official music video for the song, directed by Rich Lee, was released the following day, on May 21, 2013. It features Levine, the other members of the band and Levine\'s love interest (played by model Emily Ratajkowski) covered in paint.Promotion and touring.To promote Overexposed, Maroon 5 played a concert at the Ed Sullivan Theater in New York on June 25, 2012, as part of the Live on Letterman concert series. The band also performed Payphone on the Late Show with David Letterman a day later. Levine gave an interview and performed Payphone with the band on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon on June 28, 2012. The next day, Maroon 5 appeared on the Today Show (as part of the Toyota Summer Concert Series), playing the hits: Payphone, One More Night, Moves like Jagger and Harder to Breathe.The band started the Overexposed Tour with 4 shows in Mexico, 3 of them sold out, with the first show being on August 14, 2012 in Monterrey, Nuevo Leon, Mexico. In August, they performed 3 shows in Brazil. and visited three other South American countries.

The tour also included two shows in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia in October 2012. On September 7, 2012 Adam Levine announced that the band would be extending the tour and play some more shows, starting in early 2013. Apparently, extra eight shows in Istanbul, Auckland, Bogota, Madrid, Warsaw, Caracas and Quito were planned, but this ultimately never came to fruition. On October 22, 2012, Levine revealed the U.S. tour dates and stated that Neon Trees, Owl City, and Kelly Clarkson will be supporting them throughout the U.S. tour.Critical reception.Overexposed received generally mixed reviews from music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 54, based on 14 reviews. Evan Sawdey of PopMatters found it both interesting and flawed because of Maroon 5\'s attempt to pursue different ideas, which are ultimately unsuccessful. Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian said that the album lacks memorable hooks and charm, despite Maroon 5\'s collaboration with popular producers. Adam Markowitz of Entertainment Weekly felt that the lyrics are poorly written and that its production by several pop kingpins detracts from the band\'s performance, as the album does not consolidate its rock grit and dance-pop glitz. musicOMH\'s Martyn Young wrote that Maroon 5\'s pop-produced direction exposes their limitations and lacks subtlety. Andy Gill of The Independent found the album dull, unimaginative, and marred by inarticulate whoah-oh-oh hooks. Nick Levine of NME panned Adam Levine\'s singing and called him the sort of chump who thinks that he\'s a \'player\' but then goes and writes a song called \'Ladykiller\' about, erm, a girl. Keith Harris of Spin found the album middling with plaintive vulnerability that lacks both distractions and highlights.In a positive review for Rolling Stone, Rob Sheffield called Overexposed the band\'s best album yet and said that its first-rate, dulcet sound is complemented by sharp, womanizing lyrics. Nate Chinen of The New York Times felt that, although Levine sounds awkward when deviating from the slick style, the album further invests in their glib strengths, including Levine\'s supple voice. Stephen Thomas Erlewine, writing for AllMusic, said that the briskly contemporary album may not be as good as Hands All Over, but it will ensure the band\'s commercial momentum. American Songwriter magazine\'s Eric Allen believed that newer fans of the band from today\'s beat oriented downloading musical culture will be excited by Overexposed, although it may alienate their older fans and music snobs.Commercial performance.Overexposed debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200, behind Linkin Park\'s Living Things, with sales of 222,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan. A little over 1,000 copies sold separates the two titles. Living Things also kept the album from reaching number one in many other countries. Overexposed is the band\'s fourth studio album, and follows 2010\'s Hands All Over, which also peaked at number 2, selling 142,000 in its first week.

Post-metal is the favored name for the growing genre, but it is also referred to as metalgaze or shoegaze metal as a play on shoegazing, as well as atmospheric metal, and experimental metal, though this last term is also used to describe avant-garde metal.History.According to Aaron Turner of Isis, experimental bands such as Melvins, Godflesh and Neurosis laid the groundwork for us [...] we\'re part of a recognizable lineage. Although Neurosis and Godflesh appeared earlier and display elements befitting post-metal, Isis, who like Neurosis are linked to the sludge metal scene, are often credited with laying down the conventions and definition of the genre in less nebulous terms, with their release of Oceanic in 2002.Helmet\'s albums Meantime (1992) and Betty (1994) are cited as having eschewed the traditional concept of heavy music and having trademarked the drop-D power-groove in 5/4. They may be considered definitive texts in post-metal.Previously, Tool had been labelled as post-metal in 1993 and 1996, as well as in 2006, after the term came into popularity.In 2009, Jim Martin of Terrorizer commented that Neurosis\' 1996 album Through Silver in Blood effectively invented the post-metal genre.Characteristics.A typical post-metal set-up includes two or three guitars, a bass guitar, synthesizers, a drum kit and a vocalist, though many post-metal acts are instrumental. The overall sound is generally very bass-heavy, with guitars often being down-tuned to B or lower, the equivalent of a seven-string guitar. Post-metal songs tend to \'evolve\' to a crescendo or climax (or multiple ones within a song), building upon a repeated theme or chord shift. As Aaron Turner of Isis states, the standard song format of verse-chorus-verse-chorus is something that has been done and redone, and it seems pointless to adhere to that structure when there are so many other avenues to explore.Criticism of the term.Since this genre is relatively new and is only represented by a small number of artists, the need for an entirely independent classification of music has occasionally been questioned by music reviewers and listeners. As a label, some see post-metal as redundant, since some bands listed as post-metal contain many elements similar to doom metal, progressive metal, sludge metal, and stoner metal. Others, however, argue that these elements have been combined and altered in ways that go beyond the boundaries of those respective genres, creating the need for a single, distinguishing label.Pelican\'s Trevor de Brauw said, I have an affinity for metal, but I don\'t think of Pelican as a metal band. So when people call us , or post-metal, or metalcore or whatever, I can see why they say that, but it\'s not something that I feel a close connection with... I feel our [music] has more in common with punk and hardcore.Isis is often cited as the source of a shared imagery in post-metal, although bands with similar visual themes playing in this style existed before Isis greatly popularized the subgenre.'),(48651843,'IPSC_Shotgun_World_Shoot','IPSC Shotgun World Shoot.The IPSC Shotgun World Shoot is the highest level shotgun match within the International Practical Shooting Confederation (IPSC), described as the Olympics of the Action Shooting Sports.The match consists of several days, comprising at least 25 separate courses of fire where the best IPSC-shooters from all around the world vie for the title of World Champion.

He served as sheriff of Shropshire and Staffordshire 1227 and 1229, as deputy for the Earl of Chester, from whom he obtained large grants of lands.

The specific epithet, canescens, refers to the off-white hairs covering the leaves.Salviacanescens was first described in 1831 by the Russian botanist Carl Anton von Meyer. The English botanist George Bentham applied the same name to a different species, which he corrected in his 1833 volume of Labiatarum Genera et Species by applying S.canescens Benth. as a synonym of Salviapallida. In 1992, the Russian botanist Y. L. Menitsky reduced the species Salviadaghestanica, originally described in 1951 by Dmitrii Ivanovich Sosnowsky, to a variety of S.canescens, thus also requiring the autonym S.canescens var. canescens.Salvia canescens var. daghestanica reaches nearly tall and wide, forming a mound with snow-white leaves that are covered with white hairs on top and bottom.

He made very expressive puppets and he developed a lot of visual effects in his movies. One of his innovations was the use of motion blur which he achieved, most likely, by the use of hidden string, which, because they were moving, didn\'t register on film during long exposures of each frame. He was a very successful in his time, making 2 films per year. His work has been restored thanks to his granddaughter, who preserved all his films from his French period.Henry Selick.Director Henry Selick is a well-known force in the world of stop motion animation, with Coraline  based on Neil Gaiman\'s best-selling novella and released in 2009  being his most recent and successful work. Coraline, the first stop motion animated feature to be shot entirely in stereoscopic 3-D, received lavish critical praise and became the second highest grossing stop motion feature in history. Kenneth Turan, writing for the Los Angeles Times, said, The third dimension comes of age with \'Coraline.\' The first contemporary film in which the 3-D experience feels intrinsic to the story instead of a Godforsaken gimmick, \'Coraline\' is a remarkable feat of imagination, a magical tale with a genuinely sinister edge. Coraline, released by Focus Features, is the first feature film made by LAIKA, an animation company based in Portland, Oregon and headed up by Travis Knight.Selick made his feature film directing debut in 1993 with The Nightmare Before Christmas, the first full-length, stop motion feature from a major studio. An instant holiday classic based on producer Tim Burton\'s story, Nightmare was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects and Selick won the International Animated Film Society\'s Annie Award for Best Creative Supervision.In 1996, Selick followed with a second feature, James and the Giant Peach, again produced by Burton, which combined stop motion animation with live-action. The film received widespread critical acclaim and won first prize at the world-renowned Annecy Film Festival in 1997.Selick studied animation at CalArts in California in the late 1970s with classmates John Lasseter, Brad Bird, and John Musker. Joe Ranft, Tim Burton, Jorgen Klubien, and Rick Heinrichs also attended CalArts, and both groups worked together at Disney Studios, with Ranft, Burton, Klubien, and Heinrichs collaborating with Selick in the years that followed on his feature films. While an animator at Disney, Selick received a grant to make an experimental short film, Seepage, that combined hand-drawn animation with life-size cut-out human figures that he animated with stop motion. Leaving Disney in the early 80\'s, Selick moved to the Bay Area of California to work on the cut-out animated feature, Twice Upon A Time as a sequence director. He went on to direct many stop motion TV ads including nine Pillsbury Doughboy spots, but it was his work on his stop motion ads for MTV and his short pilot episode, Slow Bob In The Lower Dimensions, that caught the public\'s eye and reunited him with his old friend Burton, who, fresh off his success as a live-action director, revived his brilliant idea for a film, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and asked Selick to direct it. Selick put together a studio in San Francisco called Skellington Productions with producer Kathleen Gavin and production manager Phil Lofaro and grew his small band of story artists, animators, puppet makers, set builders, and lighters  including Ranft, Eric Leighton, Trey Thomas, Anthony Scott, Paul Berry, Pete Kozachik, Bo Henry, Bonita DeCarlo, etc.  into a full-fledged production team who spent three years making the film. Burton, directing first Batman Returns and then Ed Wood Jr. in Los Angeles while Nightmare was being made up north, reviewed storyboards and footage every weeks and sent his talented collaborator, Rick Heinrichs, up north to develop the look of Halloween Town in the film.Fifteen years after the first theatrical release of Nightmare, Selick has come full circle with Coraline, leading a brilliant team of artists, animators, lighters, and technicians  many of them veterans from Nightmare  to create another hand-made, all stop motion feature film.Tim Burton.Tim Burton is very active in the field of stop motion animation. One of Burton\'s first films, Vincent, is a six-minute stop motion animation about a young boy who wants to be Vincent Price. Several of his early live-action films such as Pee Wee\'s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice made use of stop motion. In 1993, Burton produced the all-stop motion animation The Nightmare Before Christmas. The film was in production for three years due to the length of time it takes to shoot stop motion. The main characters in the film were puppets that in order to create realism in the film were structured hundreds of face models with different expressions. The film is based on a poem Burton wrote inspired by T\'was the Night Before Christmas  it was then directed by Henry Selick. Selick later directed the adaptation of James and the Giant Peach, a blend between stop motion animation and live action film. In 2005 Corpse Bride was released, another stop motion piece from Burton. Computer animation of the aliens for his 1996 science fiction comedy, Mars Attacks! was deliberately made to look like stop motion when the film\'s budget did not allow for the use of the actual stop motion process, blurring the line between the two forms of animation.Nick Park.Nick Park and the Aardman team also produce commercials and music videos, notably the video for Peter Gabriel\'s Sledgehammer, which uses many different animation techniques, including pixilation involving Gabriel holding poses while each frame was shot and moving between exposures, effectively becoming a human puppet. More recently Aardman used this technique on a series of short films for BBC Three entitled Angry Kid, which starred a live actor wearing a mask. The actor\'s pose and the mask\'s expression had to be altered slightly for each exposure. Aardman has also created many films, of which some have become household names. Nick Park joined Aardman after they took interest in his college project, A Grand Day Out. Since then, Nick Park has directed the following films for Aardman: The Wrong Trousers, Creature Comforts, A Close Shave, Cracking Contraptions, the feature film Chicken Run, and more recently, another feature film \', co-produced with DreamWorks Animation. Nick Park\'s latest work is the new Wallace and Gromit short (30 minutes) called A Matter of Loaf and Death, broadcast on BBC One on Christmas Day 2008. Nick Park has won several Academy Awards for Best Animation.Ray Harryhausen.Willis O\'Brien\'s student Ray Harryhausen made many movies using a more elaborate version of puppet animation called model animation, first pioneered by O\'Brien, mainly for his feature-length films, the difference being that model animation strives to be photo-realistic enough to be able to be combined with live action elements to create a final fantasy sequence that allows the audience to suspend their disbelief that they are watching animation elements. Example of his model animation techniques; most famously, are the seven-skeleton sequence from Jason and the Argonauts (1963). But aside from the more disguised stop motion efforts of O\'Brien and Harryhausen, America and Britain were slower to embrace the stop motion film, and so its use mainly grew out of other locations and sources.Phil Tippett.In the mid-1970s, Phil Tippett, a stop motion animator inspired by the works of Willis O\'Brien and Ray Harryhausen, was tapped by George Lucas to work on Star Wars. After creating the Chess Set sequence and participating in the Cantina scene as a member of the monster band for the seminal movie, Phil was enlisted to join Lucas when he relocated ILM from Los Angeles to the Bay Area.During Tippett\'s tenure at ILM he earned an enduring place in the Star Wars galaxy by animating the Imperial Walkers and Tauntaun in The Empire Strikes and then was knighted as head of the studio\'s creature shop for Return of the Jedi. In addition to his artistic contributions Tippett\'s technical ingenuity was evident with the invention of the \'Go-Motion\' animation technique in 1982  a forerunner of todays computer graphic imaging. He earned his first Academy Award nomination for Dragonslayer and by 1983 received his first Oscar for Return of the Jedi.In 1984, Tippett left ILM and, along with his partner Jules Roman, founded Tippett Studio in a garage in Berkeley to create a 10-minute experimental film called Prehistoric Beast. The Emmy award winning CBS special, Dinosaur!, quickly followed it.Fast forward several decades, the company now occupies four buildings in Berkeley, employs up to 200 artists and technicians and is best known for its outstanding CG character animation work.The early days of Tippett Studio saw sequences designed, built and animated using stop motion for movies like Robocop, with the out of control robot ED209, and later Robocop 2, with the evil mayhem created by the Cain robot.George Pal.One acclaimed European puppet animation producer to break out in America was Hungarian animator George Pal, who, partially working in The Netherlands, produced a series of films in Europe during the 30s before coming to Hollywood to create more shorts in the 40s, now called Puppetoons under the Paramount banner, seven of which were nominated for Academy Awards for best animated film. In the late 40s, Pal evolved into feature film production, incorporating puppet animation into a live action setting in such films as The Great Rupert (1949), tom thumb (film) (1958), and The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm (1962). Pal used model animation (animated by Jim Danforth) in two other feature films, The Time Machine (1960) and 7 Faces of Dr. Lao (1964), the latter nominated for a Special Effects Oscar, and the former winning the EFX Oscar award. Pal\'s work is documented in two feature films by Arnold Lebovitt, released in the mid-80s, The Puppetoon Movie and The Fantastic World of George Pal which are currently available on DVD. More of Danforth\'s skilled model animation can be seen in Jack the Giant Killer (1962), the ending fire ladder sequence for It\'s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World (1963), The Zanti Misfits and Counterweight episodes of the original The Outer Limits TV series (1963), and, with equally prolific model animator David Allen, in Equinox (also titled The Beast) (1967, 1970), Flesh Gordon (1974), and the prehistoric comedy Caveman (1981).Cuppa Coffee Studios.Cuppa Coffee Studios is based in Toronto and has also pioneered many of the modern techniques associated with stop motion. Started in 1992 by Adam Shaheen, the company has grown to now the single largest producer of stop motion for TV with over 250 employees and 48 Studios. All production is conducted at the facility.They have produced the classic Celebrity Deathmatch, Rick and Steve, Starveillance, A Very Barry Christmas and JoJo\'s Circus and Glenn Martin DDS, Life\'s a Zoo, A Miser Brothers Christmas, Crashbox and Ugly Americans. The studio has won over 200 international broadcast awards for its work and an award winning Commercial and Broadcast Design Departments.Suzie Templeton.Suzie Templeton is most famous for her work on the film Peter and the Wolf for which she won the 2008 Academy Award for best Short Film (Animated).Adam Jones.Adam Jones, Grammy Award-winning guitarist/musician/visual artist for the Grammy Award-winning progressive rock band Tool, uses stop motion capturing techniques for the majority of Tool\'s music videos as well. With the exception of Hush, the band members of Tool do not appear in their videos, but rather use a combination of clay animation and stop motion. Jones\' studies began in 1983 at the Hollywood Makeup Academy by learning straight make-up. His focus of interest shifted to film, and he began to work as a sculptor and special effects designer for such films as Jurassic Park and \'. It was here where he learned the stop motion camera techniques he would later apply in Tool\'s music videos: Sober (on which he collaborated with Fred Stuhr), Prison Sex, Stinkfist, nema, Schism, and Parabola. The techniques and style of Tool\'s music videos, particularly Sober and Prison Sex, borrow heavily from the work of The Brothers Quay.Willis O\'Brien.The great pioneer of American stop motion was Willis O\'Brien. In 1914, O\'Brien began animating a series of short subjects set in prehistoric times. He animated his early creations by covering wooden armatures with clay, a technique he further perfected by using ball & socket armatures covered with foam, foam latex, animal hair and fur. Birth of a Flivver (1915), Morpheus Mike (1915), \' (1916), \' (1917/18), The Ghost of Slumber Mountain (1919), The Lost World (1925), King Kong (1933), The Son of Kong (1933), and, with the assistance of a young Ray Harryhausen, Mighty Joe Young (1949), yet these were but a few of the many films he animated. O\'Brien\'s Nippy\'s Nightmare (1916) was the first film to combine live actors with stop motion characters. His partnership with the great Mexican-American model makers/craftsmen/special effects artists/background painters/set builders, Marcel Delgado, Victor Delgado and Mario Larrinaga, led to some of the most memorable and remarkable stop motion moments in film history.O\'Brien\'s imaginative use of stop motion, and his ambitious and inventive filmmaking, has inspired generations of film greats such as Ray Harryhausen, George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Peter Jackson, Jim Danforth, Art Clokey, Pete Kleinow, Tim Burton, David Allen, Phil Tippett and Will Vinton, as well as thousands of lesser known animators, both professional and amateur. Many leading science fiction and fantasy writers also credit him as a great source of inspiration.Lou Bunin.Puppeteer Lou Bunin created one of the first stop motion puppets using wire armatures and his own rubber formula. Another early stop motion piece by Bunin, also in the 1930s was Bury the Axis, a short, satiric film about World War II probably commissioned for the US Government as a WPA grant. Bunin went on to produce a feature-length film version of Alice in Wonderland with a live-action Alice and stop motion puppets portraying all the rest of the characters. Bunin was blacklisted in the 1950s, putting an effective end to his commercial career. He then turned his attention to painting and drawing, while still creating numerous TV commercials using stop motion techniques, as well as a number of children\'s short films.Charles Bowers.One of the more idiosyncratic early users of stop motion techniques was the American comedian and cartoonist Charles Bowers who employed stop motion techniques (which he called the Bowers Process) in his series of silent short comedies in the 1920s and early 1930s. In his 1926 film Now You Tell One, he skillfully uses stop motion to create such effects as a straw hat growing on a man\'s head, cats growing out of a plant, and a mouse firing a gun. His color film, Pete Roleum and His Cousins, a promotion piece about the importance of oil in contemporary life, debuted in the 1939 New York World\'s Fair.Disney.The Walt Disney studio dabbled with puppet object animation in 1959 with the release of a 21-minute experimental short, Noah\'s Ark, nominated for an animated film Oscar for that year. Disney didn\'t exploit the technique until their associations with Mike Jittlov in the 1970s.Disney once again experimented with several stop motion techniques by hiring independent animator-director Mike Jittlov to do the first stop motion animation of Mickey Mouse toys ever produced for a short sequence called Mouse Mania, part of a TV special commemorating Mickey Mouse\'s 50th Anniversary called Mickey\'s 50th in 1978.Rankin/Bass.In North America, Arthur Rankin, Jr. and Jules Bass of Bass Productions produced a series of popular Christmas and non-holiday TV specials and feature films such as Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer in 1964, and the TV series The New Adventures of Pinocchio in the early 1960s using \'Animagic\', their trade name for their version of stop motion puppetry. The specials were animated in Japan by Japanese stop motion pioneer Tadahito Mochinaga (in the 1960s) and the other Animagic supervisors in a Tokyo-based studio called \'MOM Productions\'. Another clay animated children\'s TV series Davey and Goliath, produced by Art Clokey, lasted from 1960 to 1977. Rankin and Bass also produced the puppet animation feature-length film Mad Monster Party in 1967, and combined puppet animation with live action in the 1966 feature film The Daydreamer, and along with cel animation in the ABC TV special \' in 1972.Jackie Cockle.In the UK, Jackie Cockle is an important figure in the pre-school stop frame animation scene. She was the creative producer of the worldwide success Bob the Builder, and is the creator and producer of Timmy Time. Since 2002, Cockle has won 3 BAFTA awards.Art Clokey.Art Clokey is best known for the clay character Gumby and for the show Davey and Goliath.Corky Quakenbush.Corky Quakenbush created three dozen stop motion animated films for Fox network\'s Mad TV in the late 1990s that helped fuel a movement of comic stop motion for adults. Parodying famous feature movies and TV shows, the shorts drew their humor from the mixing of the innocence of puppets and the profanity of violence in mainstream contemporary situations. One example is Raging Rudolph, written by Spencer Green and Mary Vilano, a re-telling of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer as if directed by Martin Scorsese. Quakenbush also created reality animation to mimic hand-held documentary newsgathering for Clops, written by Blaine Capatch, a parody of the groundbreaking reality show, Cops in which puppet police bust famous stop motion characters. Other parodies followed, such as Furious George, a spoof of the innocent Curious George children\'s book series.Other notable artists.Other notable artists include the influential Czech animator Ji Trnka. The aesthetic tradition of the puppet film was continued by Bretislav Pojar, Kihachir Kawamoto, Ivo Caprino, Jan vankmajer, Ji Barta, the (Brothers Quay), bolexbrothers and Galina Beda.A notable stop motion object animator was Germany\'s Oskar Fischinger, who animated anything he could get his hands on in a series of short abstract art films during the 20s and 30s. The best example is his 1934 film, Composition in Blue. Fischinger was hired by Disney to animate the rolling hills footage used in the opening Toccata & Fugue sequence of Fantasia (1940).'),(15092861,'David_Ireland_(artist)','David Ireland (artist).David Kenneth Ireland (August 25, 1930  May 17, 2009) was an American artist and co-founder of the Capp Street Project artist residency.Born in Bellingham, Washington, he studied Printmaking and Industrial Arts at California College of Arts and Crafts, prior to joining the Army in the early 1950s. After leaving the Army Ireland traveled Europe extensively, working as an illustrator, and eventually traveled to Africa to lead safaris. It was not until his 40s that Ireland decided to dedicate himself to work as a full-time artist. He returned to the United States and returned to school, this time at the San Francisco Art Institute. Upon graduating from the San Francisco Art Institute Ireland spent a year working in New York, before returning to settle in San Francisco.Ireland is most well known for creating site-specific installation art pieces; most notably, his former residence at in San Francisco, where his work is also shown at Gallery Paule Anglim. Moving between two and three dimensions within the same sculptures, Ireland explores concepts of scale and vision. Known for his wide range of materials, works are made from paint cans, phone books, metal, cement, wood and, even the skull of a water buffalo.In 1999, Ireland collaborated with sound artist GX Jupitter-Larsen remixing and re-recording tapes from the audio achieves of 500 Capp St. The outcome was released as a on Vinyl Communications.To accompany Ireland\'s first solo exhibition in London, Ridinghouse published David Ireland: Sculptures, Paintings, Drawings. This catalogue features a selection of Irelands works from over four decades. A good introduction to the work of this fascinating artist, this publication also includes an essay by Kenneth Baker, art critic of the San Francisco Chronicle.External links.Book by Betty Klausner: Touching Time and Space - a Portrait of David Ireland 2003, www.chartartbooks.it'),(3258084,'The_Verge_(XM)','The Verge (XM).The Verge is a Sirius XM Canada channel featuring new and emerging rock bands from Canada. The channel is produced in Toronto, Ontario for the entire SiriusXM platform. The channel\'s former names included Unsigned, and (un)Signed, which indicated that the channel played a combination of signed and unsigned bands. A few American songs, such as Hard Sun by Eddie Vedder (written and originally performed by a Canadian) are played on the channel. In August 2015, The Verge was added to the Sirius channel lineup.Radio Unsigned (20022005).XM launched the original Unsigned channel (notice no parenthesis) in its rock selection as an outlet for all the unsigned rock bands out there to receive nationwide exposure. In addition to unsigned rock music, one of these bands would also have the opportunity to have Unsigned play their favorite popular band at a certain time each day. A popular show on Unsigned was The R>A>D>A>R Report, which actually started via internet in the late 1990s as a showcase for unsigned rockers. XM Satellite Radio picked up the show for its Unsigned channel, and the show now had a wide audience to broadcast to beginning on January 3, 2003. As Unsigned continued its parade of no-name up and comer rock bands, sister rocker XMU on XM 43 was also growing with its selection of independent and college rock. After a while, it looked as if XMU and Unsigned were slowly becoming the same channel, with similar bands being played. Some XM fans suggested a merger of the two channels, while others suggested niching the playlists a little more. On November 16, 2005, the merger people got their wish.(un)Signed (20052006).In June 2005, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission gave XM\'s partner, Canadian Satellite Radio, the license to broadcast satellite radio in Canada. With this came some rules and regulations regarding Canadian content, forcing the birth of new channels on the line-up. Some channels were newborns, some were deleted completely and replaced with new ones, Unsigned on the other hand was the only one to be moved and reformatted. Thus, (un)Signed was born. (un)Signed was born as a station for new and emerging rock artists from Canada, and is currently on the entire XM platform in both nations. To maintain 100% Canadian content, The R>A>D>A>R Report was moved to XMU where it continues to broadcast weekly shows with encores. XMU did not receive a name change, but it now makes up more for the loss of the old Unsigned\'s playlist.The Verge (2006).As of April 17, 2006, (un)Signed has renamed itself The Verge. The station now has DJs scheduled around the clock on extended shifts, and features the series LiVE@theVerge, which airs Wednesdays @ 6ET and replays Sunday @ 9ET. In the past LiVE@theVerge has included performances from Sam Roberts, The New Pornographers, Stars, The Stills, Wintersleep, Small Sins and over 300 artists from their street front studios in Toronto.In June 2008, The Verge broadcast the Calgary Virgin Festival live. Performances included Matthew Good, The Flaming Lips, Three Days Grace, City and Colour and Stars. In September 2008, The Verge broadcast the Toronto Virgin Festival live, including performances by Oasis, Paul Weller, Bloc Party, MGMT, Silversun Pickups, Stereophonics, Constantines and The Fratellis.On November 12, 2008, as part of the Sirius XM merger, The Verge moved from channel 52 to channel 87 on the XM service. It is still listed as X052-FM by Mediabase. Channel 52 is now Faction. Radio personality and music journalist Kim Hughes hosted programming in 2010.This channel, Laugh Attack, Radio Parallle, and/or ATN-Asian Radio will be preempted by XM Radio Canada in order to air extra NHL play-by-play on channels 235-239.Verge Awards.In July 2008, XM Canada instituted The Verge Music Awards, an award to be voted on by the fans in conjunction with an XM appointed jury to determine the winner based on artistic integrity.The inaugural winners were announced on September 24, 2008 at The Tattoo Rock Parlour in Toronto. The Weakerthans were named Artist of the Year and Hey Rosetta!\'s album Into Your Lungs was named Album of the Year.In the second annual Verge Music Awards, which were handled out on September 22, 2009 and broadcast live-to-air, Dan Mangan was awarded the Verge Artist of the Year and Alexisonfire was given the Verge Album of the Year Award for their cd Young Cardinals.'),(24698597,'Ressu_Upper_Secondary_School','Ressu Upper Secondary School.Ressu Upper Secondary School () is a school located in central Helsinki, Finland. Founded in 1891, Ressu is one of the oldest Finnish speaking schools and considered to be one of the most prestigious schools in Finland. Ressu is one of the most difficult upper secondary schools to gain entry to in Finland, with admission typically requiring grade point averages above 9.3 on the Finnish scale of 4.0 (the lowest) to 10.0 (the highest). Students in Ressu have a reputation of moving onto illustrious careers in further education, in a range of top universities both in Finland and abroad. The current principal is Ari Huovinen from Helsinki.History.The school was founded in 1891 at which time it was called Helsingin Suomalainen Realilyseo (the Helsinki Finnish Real Lyceum), at which point it only taught male students. The teaching concentrated on broadening the previously strict and narrow subject areas, that were held mostly in Latin, to also include other languages as well as a selection of sciences. Gradually the school\'s name changed. In 1914 it became Helsingin Suomalainen Lyseo, and in 1950, due to pressure from the school\'s Swedish-speaking minority, it was changed to simply Helsingin Lyseo. When governorship of the school transferred from the Republic of Finland to the city of Helsinki in 1977, the school was told to choose a name based on its geographic location. However, due to large-scale student campaigning, the school was officially named after its long-standing nickname: Ressun lukio.Campus.The campus of Ressu Upper Secondary School consists of a single building in central Helsinki. It is situated on Lnnrotinkatu, across the road from the Old Church of Helsinki. The building is divided into four floors, with the lowest floor lacking dedicated classrooms and instead hosting other facilities for students, such as the school\'s cafeteria Papa Huovinen\'s (facetiously named after the school\'s principal), the school\'s library, two computer rooms, and the offices of the school\'s doctors.Curriculum.Ressun lukio offers the Finnish upper comprehensive programme held in Finnish, as well as the English IB Diploma Programme since 2002. Their first IB graduates graduated in 2005. About 120 of the 700 students are in the IB section, and the rest are taught in Finnish. The International Baccalaureate students tend to continue their education in Higher Education abroad, typically the United Kingdom and the United States.Extracurricular activities.The Ressu Chess Club is one of the top-performing chess clubs in the Helsinki regional area. In their second year the students also have the possibility of partaking in Wanhojen tanssit (resembles the U.S equivalent of prom), and perform traditional ballroom dances in the White Hall (Valkoinen Sali) in the center of Helsinki, near to the Home of the President on Helsinki Esplanad. Other extracurricular activities include the school choir, debate club, and the school newspapers.Ressu Traditions.Ressu legend holds that upon graduation, the graduating class of students compose a Bingo game, made up of the catch-phrases that the Principal is expected to say upon his congratulatory speech and printed onto sheets of paper which are distributed to the audience. Any student who attains a Bingo must stand up and shout out \'Bingo\' in front of the graduating class. Two students are said to have attained Bingos, one of them was rebuked, but went onto an eminent career in education and ultimately became Principal of the rivalling school SYK, bringing its scores higher than those attained at Ressu in 1994.In front of the Ressu Upper Secondary School building is a statue of Elias Lnnrot, a prominent cultural figure in Finnish history. Legend has it that during the period in which Ressu was an all-boys school, male students found a small crevice in the hollow base of the statue and hid a bundle of influential writings from the time of the Finnish Declaration of Independence in 1917. The Helsinki Cultural Society has declared the statue a protected landmark, and the issue cannot be investigated. However, popular belief holds that the papers are written by General Gustav Mannerheim and addressed to his mistress in Paris.'),(37611240,'Falconar_SAL_Mustang','Falconar SAL Mustang.The Falconar SAL Mustang, also called the 2/3 Mustang and the SAL P-51D Mustang is a Canadian amateur-built aircraft, produced by Falconar Avia and introduced in 1969. The aircraft is a scale replica of the North American P-51 Mustang and is supplied as a kit or as plans for amateur construction.Design and development.In 1963 Falconar partnered with designer Marcel Jurca to produce the Jurca Gnatsum. By 1967, Falconar recommended a large number of changes to the design, which resulted in Jurca leaving the project. The modified aircraft was developed as the SAL Mustang and first flown in 1971 after significant cost overruns. Falconar Aircraft Ltd was sold to George F. Chivers and other investors, and operated as Sturgeon Air Ltd (SAL) with Falconar as an employee until 1973.The SAL Mustang features a cantilever low-wing, a single-seat, or optionally a two-seats-in-tandem, enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, retractable conventional landing gear, including a manually retractable tailwheel and a single engine in tractor configuration.The aircraft is made from wood covered with fibreglass cloth and doped aircraft fabric. Some parts, like the belly air scoop are made from fibreglass. Its span wing has an area of and mounts flaps that may be electrically or manually operated. The cockpit is wide and the bubble canopy is jettisonable. The aircraft\'s recommended engine power range is. Engines that have been used include the Lycoming IO-360 horizontally opposed engine, the Ranger L-440 inverted inline, the Avia M 337 inverted inline, Continental O-470 horizontally opposed, the Ford V6 automotive conversion, as well as other automotive V-6 or V-8 powerplants. Construction time from the supplied kit is estimated as 2500 hours.The paper plans supplied total an area of, weigh and include a construction manual. An alternative set of plans allows constructing a tandem two-seat version. The plans are very detailed and complete and one builder rated them as the best I have seen on any homebuilt airplane.Operational history.The prototype was introduced at the 1971 EAA airshow painted in the same gold and red colors as the Canadian Golden Hawks airshow team.In July 2012 the manufacturer indicated that 18 examples had been completed and flown in the 43 years that the plans and kits had been available.'),(13534959,'USS_Trumbull_(1800)','USS Trumbull (1800).USS Trumbull, the third US Navy ship to bear the name, was an 18-gun sloop-of-war that took part of the so-called Quasi-War between the United States and France, between 1800 and 1801.Construction.US Congress authorized the construction of naval ships and expansion of the US Navy in response to large losses of merchant ships to French privateers throughout the Atlantic coasts. On 30 March 1799, Benjamin Stoddert ordered Howland & Allyn Naval Agency from New London, Connecticut, the construction of a 360-ton ship with no more than 18 guns, but big enough to carry supplies for 6-months of sailing and a crew of 120 men. The Trumbull was launched in Norwich, on the morning of 26 November of that same year.Service history.Following fitting out, it departed New London in March 1800 under the command of Master Commandant David Jewett. Its first mission was to escort the provisions ship Charlotte from New York to the West Indies, replenishing the American Squadron operating against the French.Trumbull joined the American Squadron commanded by Silas Talbot in the. Trumbull\'s main duties in the area were protection of American shipping and the interception of French privateers and merchantmen.In early May 1800, the armed French schooner Peggie was captured. On 3 August, while off Jeremie in Saint-Domingue (future Haiti), Captain David Jewett on the Trumbull captured the French schooner Vengeance, armed with eight or ten guns (not, as is sometimes found, the 38-gun frigate Vengeance that tangled with the USS Constellation and was later taken into the Royal Navy). The ship was fleeing Saint-Domingue with 130 people aboard, crew and refugees together. The refugees were mostly gens de couleur libres (also known as mulattos) escaping the forces of Toussaint Louverture who had defeated Andr Rigaud\'s army in the War of Knives. Talbot ordered Jewett home with Trumbull and Vengeance as a prize. Both ships arrived at New London late that summer. For a little less than a year, those aboard the Vengeance were stationed in Norwich, Connecticut as prisoners of war, and among them was Jean-Pierre Boyer, future president of Haiti. The Vengeance was later condemned as a national vessel and was returned to France under the treaty soon afterwards concluded with that country.Trumbull then returned to patrol off Santo Domingo, before later transporting Navy Agent Thomas T. Gantt to St. Kitts to relieve Thomas Clarkson. Following the end of hostilities with France as a result of the Treaty of Mortefontaine, Trumbull returned to the United States in the spring of 1801, was sold later that year and her crew discharged.'),(6153487,'Oklahoma_City_metropolitan_area','Oklahoma City metropolitan area.The Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area is a large urban region located in Central Oklahoma and is the state\'s largest metropolitan area. It is often known as the Oklahoma City Metro or Greater Oklahoma City, and contains the state capital and principal city, Oklahoma City.Seven counties make up the Oklahoma City Metropolitan Area: Canadian, Cleveland, Grady, Lincoln, Logan, McClain, and Oklahoma. According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the region had a population of 1,252,987.The micro urban area of Shawnee (in Pottawatomie County) is included in Oklahoma City\'s Combined Statistical Area (CSA) which brings the region\'s population to 1,322,429.

Norman is also the hometown of movie star James Garner and country music star Vince Gill.Noble, Purcell, Lexington, and Slaughterville.These four suburbs/exurbs lie south of Norman along the I-35 and US-77 corridors. Multimillion-dollar horse farms give the area much commerce and appearance of great wealth. Steady growth continues, although not as rapid as the southwest metro, it is growing in popularity with new residents seeking acreages and small school systems as numbers of Norman residents experience changing dynamics of traffic, and crowded schools, stores that follow rapid population growth.Noble is known as the Rose-Rock Capital of the World for its abundance of soil-bound barium sulfate. Slaughterville was thrust into the public spotlight by a recent campaign by PETA to change the name of the town to Veggieville, though the town was named after a James Slaughter, not for the killing of animals.Purcell, OK was founded as a railroad town in 1887, with the coming of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad and is the retail hub of 21,300 residents including several surrounding communities including Criner, Payne, Wayne, Washington and Woody Chapel and surrounding unincorporated rural areas of McClain County as well as Lexington in southern Cleveland County.

Goldsby is known for its Chickasaw Nation casinos: Goldsby Gaming Center, and Riverwind Casino, which is one of the largest casinos in Oklahoma.Newcastle, Tuttle, Blanchard, and Bridge Creek.Traveling along I-44 southwest from the City takes one into the fastest-growing part of the metro, which is known as Tri-City after its major constituents: Newcastle, Tuttle and Blanchard, Oklahoma. The area surrounds the tiny town of Bridge Creek. These suburbs have experienced rapid growth over the past 510 years as the result of people moving further from downtown Oklahoma City with an estimated combined population of 21,374 (2010 census). Though these communities have suffered growing pains, the increased residential and business development is improving the governments\' abilities to improve the infrastructure needs while increasing services available. Newcastle serves as the epicenter of business development for the region but all of the communities are seeing growth in these arenas.Bridge Creek suffered incredible damage from an F5 tornado during the Oklahoma tornado outbreak of May 3, 1999. Blanchard and Newcastle suffered damages in the tornado outbreak of May 24, 2011 with the loss or damages of over 350 homes and over 20 businesses, however no lives were lost.Chickasha.Chickasha, an exurb of Oklahoma City, is located along I-44 southwest of the City.

He reigned from 48 to 33 BC. Emperor Yuan was remembered for the promotion of Confucianism as the official creed of Chinese government. He appointed Confucius adherents to important government posts.However, at the same time that he was solidifying Confucianism\'s position as the official ideology, the empire\'s condition slowly deteriorated due to his indecisiveness and inability to stop factional infighting between officials in his administration, and his trusting of certain corrupt officials.Family background.When Emperor Yuan was born as Liu Shi in 75 BC, his parents Liu Bingyi and Xu Pingjun were commoners without titles. Bingyi was the great-grandson of Emperor Wu, and his grandfather Liu Ju was Emperor Wu\'s crown prince, until he was forced by Emperor Wu\'s paranoia into a failed rebellion in 91 BC while Bingyi was still just an infant, in the aftermaths of which Prince Ju committed suicide and virtually his entire family was wiped out. Bingyi was spared because of his young age, but became a commoner and survived on the largess of others. One of whom was chief eunuch Zhang He, who had been an advisor for Prince Ju before his rebellion, and who was punished by being castrated.Circa 76 BC, Zhang wanted to marry his granddaughter to Bingyi, but his brother Zhang Anshi (), then an important official, opposed, fearing that it would bring trouble. Zhang, instead, invited one of his subordinate eunuchs (who had also been castrated by Emperor Wu), Xu Guanghan (), to dinner, and persuaded him to marry his daughter Xu Pingjun to Liu Bingyi. When Xu\'s wife heard this, she became extremely angry and refused, but because Zhang was Xu\'s superior, Xu did not dare to renege on the promise, and Bingyi and Pingjun were married, in a ceremony entirely paid by Zhang (because Bingyi could not afford to). Zhang also paid the bride price. After marriage, Bingyi heavily depended on his wife\'s family for support.Childhood and career as crown prince.Shi was only less than a year old when something highly unusual would happen to his father. Shi\'s great-granduncle, Emperor Zhao had died that year, and the regent Huo Guang, having been dissatisfied with his initial selection of Prince He of Changyi, deposed Prince He and offered the throne to the commoner Bingyi instead. Bingyi accepted, and took the throne as Emperor Xuan. Shi\'s mother Xu Pingjun was created empress.This action would cost Empress Xu her life, however, and cost Prince Shi his mother. Huo Guang\'s wife, Xian (), would not be denied her wish of making her daughter Huo Chengjun () an empress. In 71 BC, Empress Xu was pregnant when Lady Xian came up with a plot. She bribed Empress Xu\'s female physician Chunyu Yan (), under guise of giving Empress Xu medicine after she gave birth, to poison her. Chunyu did so, and Empress Xu died shortly after she gave birth. Her doctors were initially arrested to investigate whether they cared for the empress properly. Lady Xian, alarmed, informed Huo Guang what had actually happened, and Huo, not having the heart to turn in his wife, instead signed Chunyu\'s release.In 70 BC, Emperor Xuan created Huo Chengjun empress. Accustomed to luxury living, her palace expenditures far exceeded the late Empress Xu. Her becoming empress would threaten Prince Shi\'s life, as in 67 BC, Emperor Xuan created the eight-year-old Crown Prince Shi and created Empress Xu\'s father and Prince Shi\'s grandfather Xu Guanghan the Marquess of Ping\'enan action that Huo Guang had opposed. Huo\'s wife Lady Xian was shocked and displeased, because if her daughter were to have a son later, that son could only be a prince and not the future emperor. She instructed her daughter to murder the crown prince. Allegedly, Empress Huo did make multiple attempts to do so, but failed each time. Around this time, the emperor also heard rumors that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, which led him to begin stripping the Huos of actual power, while giving them impressive titles.In 66 BC, after there had been increasing public rumors that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, Lady Xian finally revealed to her son and grandnephews that she had, indeed, murdered Empress Xu. In fear of what the emperor might do if he had actual proof, Lady Xian, her son, her grandnephews, and her sons-in-law formed a conspiracy to depose the emperor. The conspiracy was discovered, and the entire Huo clan was executed by Emperor Xuan. For the time being, Empress Huo was deposed but not executed, but 12 years later she was exiled; in response, she committed suicide.What Empress Huo tried to do influenced Emperor Xuan in his choice of his next wife. At that time, he favored Consorts Hua, Zhang, and Wei, each of whom bore him children. He almost settled on Consort Zhang as his new empress. However, he became hesitant, remembering how Empress Huo had tried to murder the crown prince. He therefore resolved to create an empress who was childless and kind. He decided on the gentle Consort Wang, and created her empress in 64 BC. Emperor Xuan put Prince Shi in her care, and she cared for him well.Empress Wang would have a role in Crown Prince Shi\'s eventual choice of a wife. In the middle of the 50s BC, Consort Sima, the favorite consort of Prince Shi died from an illness. Prince Shi was grief-stricken and became ill and depressed himself. Emperor Xuan was concerned, so he had Empress Wang select the most beautiful of the young ladies in waiting and had them sent to Prince Shi. Wang Zhengjun was one of the ladies in waiting chosen. She bore him his first-born son Liu Ao (, later Emperor Cheng) circa 51 BC. Prince Ao became Emperor Xuan\'s favorite grandson and often accompanied him.During his years as crown prince, Prince Shi did not have a major role in government, given the forceful nature of his father\'s personality. He was taught the Confucian classics by a succession of Confucian scholars, during his pre-teen and teenage years. Prince Shi became and mild-mannered strict adherent to Confucian principles, unlike his father\'s effective use of both Legalist and Confucian principles in his governance. This would bring his father\'s ire on him. In 53 BC, once, when Emperor Xuan and Prince Shi were having dinner, he suggested that Emperor Xuan employ more Confucian officials in key positions.Emperor Xuan became extremely angry and commented that Confucian scholars were impractical and could not be given responsibilities, and further commented that Emperor Yuan would bring the downfall of the Liu imperial clanwords that would turn out to be fairly prophetic. This would also bring his father to consider changing the succession plans, as he was also disappointed by Prince Shi\'s general lack of resolve. He considered creating Prince Shi\'s younger brother Liu Qin, the Prince of Huaiyang, crown prince instead, but could not bring himself to do soremembering how Prince Shi\'s mother Empress Xu was his first love and had been murdered by poisoning, and also how he depended on his father-in-law in his youth. Prince Shi\'s position therefore was not seriously threatened.In 49 BC, Emperor Xuan fell deathly ill. Before his death, he commissioned his cousin-once-removed Shi Gao (), Prince Shi\'s teacher Xiao Wangzhi (), and Xiao\'s assistant Zhou Kan () to serve as regents. After he died, Prince Shi ascended the throne as Emperor Yuan.Reign as emperor.As emperor, Emperor Yuan immediately started a regimen of reducing governmental spending, with the objective of reducing the burdens of the people in mind. He also started a program for social assistance to provide stipends for the poor and new entrepreneurs. He also, contrary to his father\'s governing philosophy, heavily relied on Confucian scholars and put them into important governmental positions.In 48 BC, Emperor Yuan created Consort Wang Zhengjun, the mother of his first-born son Prince Ao, empress. In 47 BC, he created Prince Ao crown prince.In 46 BC, alarmed at the high human and monetary cost of occupying Hainan and suppressing the frequent native rebellions, Emperor Yuan decreed that the two commanderies on the island be abandoned. Similarly, in 40 BC, alarmed at the high cost of maintaining imperial temples, he reduced the number of standing temples.Factionalism.Quickly, in Emperor Yuan\'s administration, a factional schism developeda phenomenon that would plague his entire reign and cause officials to be concentrated on infighting rather than effective governance. One faction included mainly Confucian scholarshis teachers Xiao and Zhou, aligned with an imperial clan member who was also a Confucian scholar, Liu Gengsheng (, later named Liu Xiang ), and imperial assistant Jin Chang (). The other faction was his cousin-twice-removed Shi, imperial secretary Hong Gong () and chief eunuch Shi Xian (). The Confucian faction derived their power from the fact that Emperor Yuan trusted and respected their advice. The court faction derived their power from their physical closeness to the emperor and their key roles in processing reports and edicts for Emperor Yuan. Policy-wise, the Confucian faction advocated returning to the ancient policies of the early Zhou Dynasty, while the court faction advocated keeping the traditions of the Han Dynasty. In 47 BC, Hong and Shi used procedural traps to cause Zhou and Liu to be demoted to commoners and Xiao to be retired. Later that year, the court faction would further press Xiao into committing suicideby tricking Emperor Yuan into believing that it would be appropriate to have Xiao investigated for inducing his son to make a petition for himsomething considered inappropriate. Hong and Shi knew that with Xiao\'s temper, he would rather commit suicide than face an investigation, and that was what Xiao did. For now, the court faction had prevailed. In actions characteristic of his personality, Emperor Yuan rebuked Hong and Shi harshly for misleading him, and buried Xiao with great honor, but did not punish Hong (who died himself later that year) and Shi.In 46 BC, Emperor Yuan summoned Zhou back to his administration and gave him a mid-level office, along with Zhou\'s student Zhang Meng (, a grandson of the great explorer Zhang Qian). Despite the relatively low positions that Zhou and Zhang had, their advice was highly valued by Emperor Yuan. In 44 BC, he would also promote the highly regarded Confucian scholar Gong Yu (), who tried not to engage himself in factional politics, to the position of vice prime minister, and heeded many of his suggestions to further reduce governmental spending and to encourage the study of Confucianism.In 43 BC, there were a number of unusual astronomical and meteorological signs that were considered signs of divine disapproval. Shi Xian and his allies, the Xu and Shi clans, alleged that this was sign of divine disapproval of Zhou and Zhang\'s policies. Zhou and Zhang were demoted to local posts. In 42 BC, he promoted another Confucian scholar, Kuang Heng (), to be his key advisor, and Kuang, aware of the fate of the other Confucian scholars, entered into an alliance with Shi Xian as well to ensure his own safety and power.In 40 BC, more unusual signs occurred, and Emperor Yuan asked the court faction to explain how they could continue to occur if, as they alleged, they were signs of divine disapproval of Zhou and Zhang. They could not, and so Emperor Yuan summoned Zhou and Zhang back to the capital to serve as advisors. However, this would not last long, as Zhou soon died of a stroke, and Shi Xian found an opportunity to falsely accuse Zhang of crimes and forced him to commit suicide.Another Confucian scholar would try his luck at shaking the influence of Shi Xian, however, in 37 BC. That man was Jing Fang (), who, in addition to studying Confucianism, was also an accomplished fortuneteller. (It should be noted that at this time, fortunetelling was still considered to be a part of Confucian studiesindeed, a highly honored part; it was not until several decades later when Confucians began to disfavor fortunetelling.) Jing, who had become a trusted advisor of Emperor Yuan after Emperor Yuan greatly favored his proposed system for examining and promoting regional officials, accused Shi and Shi\'s assistant Wulu Chongzong () to be corrupt and evil. Initially, Emperor Yuan believed him, but took no actions against Shi and Wulu. Shi and Wulu soon found out and fought back by accusing Jing of conspiring with Emperor Yuan\'s brother Liu Qin, the Prince of Huaiyang, and Prince Qin\'s uncle, and Jing was executed.Victory over western Xiongnu and complete hegemony over central Asia.Around the same time, however, despite Emperor Yuan\'s general tendency for pacificism, a military confrontation with one branch of Xiongnu, which had by that time fractured into competing courts ruled by Chanyus Huhanye in the east and Zhizhi in the west. During Emperor Xuan\'s reign, Chanyu Huhanye had officially submitted to Han as a subject and received Han assistance. Chanyu Zhizhi, then the stronger of the two, tried to maintain a dtente with Han by sending his son Juyulishou (), but was not so willing to submit, and soon found himself outpowered by the Han-assisted Huhanye. In 49 BC, the last year of Emperor Xuan\'s reign, Chanyu Zhizhi headed northwest and conquered several Xiyu kingdoms, settling his capital at the old capital of one of those kingdoms, Jiankun (modern Altay, Xinjiang). From there, he often attacked the Han ally Wusun, rendering Wusun heavily wounded from those attacks.In 44 BC, Chanyu Zhizhi sent an ambassador to offer tributes to Han, but at the same time demanded that Han deliver his son Juyilishou back to him. Emperor Yuan commissioned a guard commander, Gu Ji (), to escort Juyilishou. Initially, under suggestion by Gong and other key officials, who reasoned that Zhizhi had no real intention to submit and was far away, Emperor Yuan instructed Gu to escort Juyilishou only to the Han borders, and let him make the rest of the trek on his own. Gu reasoned that by escorting Juyilishou all the way to Jiankun, he might be able to persuade Zhizhi to submit, and that he was willing to risk his own life to do so. Emperor Yuan agreed, and Gu made the escort to Jiankun. Chanyu Zhizhi was not impressed, and had Gu executed. He then realized that he made a key mistake, and he entered into an alliance with Kangju to conquer Wusun, a traditional enemy of Kangju. They repeatedly dealt Wusun heavy losses for several years.In 36 BC, two Han commandersGan Yanshou () and his lieutenant Chen Tang () would take initiative and destroy Zhizhi as a threat, however. Zhizhi, after winning many victories over Wusun and other Xiyu kingdoms, had become exceedingly arrogant, and treated his ally, the king of Kangju, as a subject, and he even executed the daughter of the king of Kangju, who had been given to him as a wife as part of the alliance. He also forced the other kingdoms in the region, even including the powerful Dayuan, to pay him tribute.Chen felt that Chanyu Zhizhi would eventually become a major threat and devised a plan to destroy him. Reasoning that Zhizhi was a powerful warrior but lacked the affection of the kingdoms that were subject to him, and also that his new capital (on the banks of Lake Balkhash) had only recently been built and lacked strong defenses, his plan was to gain requisition of the colonization forces that Han had in Xiyu and Wusun forces to advance to Zhizhi\'s capital in order to capture it. Gan agreed with his plan and wanted to request approval, but Chen feared that civilian officials would disapprove of the plan. Therefore, when Gan fell sick on one occasion, Chen forged imperial edicts and requisitioned the colonization forces as well as the forces of the kingdoms that submitted to Han authority. Once Gan recovered, he tried to reverse Chen\'s actions, but Chen warned him that it was too late to do so. They then sent out (after submitting reports impeaching themselves for forging edicts but describing the reasons for doing so), marching along two routesone half taking a route through Dayuan and the other through Wusun. The forces rejoined when they entered Kangju. They then set a trap for Zhizhi, by pretending that they were running low on suppliesto ward off the possibility that Zhizhi would flee. Zhizhi, taking the bait, stayed in his capital. The coalition forces soon arrived at his capital and besieged it, and Chanyu Zhizhi died in the battle.Both happy (that his enemy was dead) and fearful (that Han was demonstrating its might), Chanyu Huhanye made a second official visit to the Han capital of Chang\'an in 33 BC, and formally asked to become a son-in-law of Han. In response, Emperor Yuan gave him five ladies in waiting as a reward, and one of them was the beautiful Wang Zhaojun. Impressed that Emperor Yuan gave him the most beautiful woman that he had ever seen, Huhanye offered to have his forces serve as the northern defense forces for Hana proposal that Emperor Yuan rejected as ill-advisedbut the relationship between Han and Xiongnu thereafter grew stronger and stronger.Succession issues.Emperor Yuan was a relatively non-womanizing emperor, but he did have two favorite concubines in addition to Empress Wang -- Consort Fu () and Consort Feng Yuan (), each of whom bore him one son. Empress Wang apparently tried to maintain a cordial relationship with both, and she was largely successful, at least as far as Consort Feng was concerned. However, a struggle between Empress Wang and Consort Fu for their sons\' heir status would erupt.As Crown Prince Ao grew older, Emperor Yuan became increasingly unhappy with his fitness as imperial heir and impressed with Consort Fu\'s son, Prince Liu Kang of Shanyang (). Several incidents led to this situation. One happened in 35 BC, when Emperor Yuan\'s youngest brother Prince Liu Jing of Zhongshan () died, Emperor Yuan became angry when he felt that the teenage Crown Prince Ao was insufficiently grievingparticularly because Princes Ao and Jing were of similar age and grew up together as playmatesand showing insufficient respect to Prince Jing. Prince Ao\'s head of household Shi Dan (), a relative of Emperor Yuan\'s grandmother and a senior official respected by Emperor Yuan, managed to convince Emperor Yuan that Crown Prince Ao was trying to stop Emperor Yuan himself from overgrieving, but the seed of dissatisfaction was sown.As the princes further grew, several things further led to an endearment between Emperor Yuan and Prince Kang. They shared affection and skills in musicparticularly in the playing of drums. Prince Kang also showed high intelligence and diligence, while Crown Prince Ao was known for drinking and womanizing. When Emperor Yuan grew ill circa 35 BCan illness that he would not recover fromConsort Fu and Prince Kang were often summoned to his sickbed to attend to him, while Empress Wang and Crown Prince Ao rarely were. In his illness, apparently encouraged by Consort Fu, Emperor Yuan reconsidered whether he should make Prince Kang his heir instead. Only the intercession of Shi Danwho risked his life by stepping onto the carpet of the imperial bed chamber, an act that only the empress was allowed to do, at the pain of deathled Emperor Yuan to cease those thoughts. When Emperor Yuan died in 33 BC, Crown Prince Ao ascended the throne (as Emperor Cheng).'),(12130049,'Daing','Daing.Daing, Tuy, or Bulad (literally sun-dried or sun-baked) refers to dried fish from the Philippines. Fish prepared as daing are usually split open (though they may be left whole), gutted, salted liberally, and then sun and air-dried. There are also boneless variants which fillets the fish before the drying process. It was originally a preservation technique, as salt inhibits the growth of bacteria, allowing fish to be stored for long periods of time.A variant of daing known as labtingaw uses less salt and is dried for a much shorter period (only a few hours). The resulting daing is still slightly moist and meatier than the fully dried variant. Yet another variant of daing known as lamayo, does away with the drying process altogether. Instead, after the fish is cleaned, it is simply marinated in vinegar, garlic and other spices before frying.Daing is considered poverty food due to its relative cheapness. But it has gained significance in Philippine culture as comfort food. Danggit is usually simply fried before consumption and served with rice and a dip (usually vinegar or calamansi). As breakfast food, they may be served with fried eggs.In Central and Southern Philippines, daing is known as bulad or buwad in Cebuano. The variants which use sliced and gutted fish are known as pinikas (literally halved referring to the halves of the fish). Northern regions usually do not distinguish between the two, though some may use daing to refer exclusively to the halved and gutted variants, while tuy is used for all variants.Virtually any fish can be prepared as daing. The species of fish used is usually identified by name when sold in markets. For example, in Cebu, a local specialty is buwad danggit which uses rabbitfish (Siganus spp., locally known as danggit). Other fish species used include threadfin breams (Nemipteridae, locally known as bisugo); grey mullets (Mugilidae, locally known as banak); and sardines (Sardinella spp. and Dussumieria acuta, locally known as tunsoy or tamban). Daing made from sardines are usually dried whole, though exported variants may be gutted to comply with food laws in other countries. Cuttlefish and squid may also be prepared this way (Tagalog: daing na pusit; Cebuano: bulad pusit).'),(26457859,'London_Country_North_West','London Country North West.London Country North West was a bus operator in South East England and London.

His grandfather Liu Zhengchen () had served as the Tang military governor (Jiedushi) of Pinglu Circuit (, then headquartered in modern Chaoyang, Liaoning) during the Anshi Rebellion and combatted the army of the rebel Yan, but was unable to capture the Yan northern capital Fanyang before being poisoned by his own subordinate Wang Xuanzhi (). During the time that Liu Wu\'s uncle Liu Quanliang () served as the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan), as he valued Liu Wu for Liu Wu\'s bravery and decisiveness, he made Liu Wu an officer under him, but Liu Wu subsequently committed a crime and fled to Zhaoyi Circuit (, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), where the military governor of Zhaoyi, Wang Qianxiu (), made him an officer. Liu Wu soon became ill and resigned, and he went to the eastern capital Luoyang. Liu Quanliang had a storage of money at Luoyang, and Liu Wu broke into it and spent it. Liu Wu also associated with violent young men who killed people and dogs. As a result, Liu Wu was arrested and held at the jail of Henan Municipality (, i.e., the Luoyang region), but the defender of Luoyang Wei Xiaqing () released him.Service under Li Shigu and Li Shidao.Liu Wu subsequently fled to Pinglu Circuit (by this point headquartered in modern Tai\'an, Shandong) to serve under the military governor Li Shigu, who ruled the circuit in de facto independence from the imperial government. Liu was not initially well known in the Pinglu army. On one occasion, when the officers were playing polo, his horse charged Li Shigu\'s horse, causing Li Shigu\'s horse to fall. Li Shigu, in anger, was set to execute him. Liu responded with proud words without fear. Li Shigu was amazed and pardoned him, and found a wife for him. He thereafter was promoted several times, until he became army commander (, Bingmashi).In 818, after Emperor Xianzong declared a general campaign against Li Shigu\'s brother and successor Li Shidao, Li Shidao had Liu command troops to defend against imperial armies\' attack, in position at Cao Prefecture (, in modern Heze, Shandong). It was said that Liu was lenient and simplified the military laws, and as a result the soldiers were happy to be under his command  such that he was referred to as Father Liu. After Tian Hongzheng the military governor of Weibo Circuit (, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei) crossed the Yellow River and pressured Pinglu\'s capital Yun Prefecture () directly in winter 818, Liu stationed his army at Yanggu (, in modern Liaocheng, Shandong) to defend against Tian. Tian\'s army repeatedly prevailed over Liu\'s, and there were accusations by some of Li Shidao\'s associates that Liu was plotting against him. Li Shidao thus summoned Liu back to Yun Prefecture under the guise of a strategic meeting but planned to execute him. Yet other associates of Li Shidao\'s counseled that if he put Liu to death without proof of treachery, no one would remain faithful to him. After keeping Liu at Yun Prefecture for 10 days, Li Shidao ordered him to return to Yanggu and gave him gifts to try to secure his loyalty. However, because Liu Wu\'s son Liu Congjian served in Li Shidao\'s guard corps, he found out about what Li Shidao had originally intended and reported it to Liu Wu, so Liu Wu secretly took precautions.In spring 819, Li Shidao became resolved to kill Liu Wu. He sent two messengers to Liu\'s deputy Zhang Xian (), ordering Zhang to execute Liu and take over the army. When the messengers informed Zhang, Zhang, who was friendly with Liu, secretly informed Liu, who immediately put the two messengers to death. Liu then called a meeting with all of his officers, declaring that he was set to turn against Li Shidao and follow imperial orders. When some officers hesitated, he executed them, as well as a number of others that soldiers had resented. The other officers were intimidated into submission. At night, they launched a surprise attack on Yun Prefecture, and the Yun Prefecture defenders, believing that Liu was returning on Li Shidao\'s orders, allowed them in. Liu Wu controlled the city and arrested Li Shidao and his two sons, putting them to death. He then sent messengers to surrender to Tian, but continued to maintain control over Yun Prefecture.As Jiedushi.Because Emperor Xianzong had previously issued an edict stating that whoever killed Li Shidao would be conferred all of Li Shidao\'s titles, Liu Wu believed that he would be given Pinglu\'s 12 prefectures, and therefore started making personnel changes for the entire circuit. Meanwhile, though, Emperor Xianzong was secretly planning to divide Pinglu into three circuits and transferring Liu elsewhere, but was concerned that Liu might resist. He ordered Tian to evaluate the situation, and Tian thus sent messengers to Liu, ostensibly to befriend Liu, but secretly to observe Liu. As Liu was strong and liked arm wrestling, within three days, he was encouraging soldiers to arm wrestle and watching them doing so in excitement. When the Weibo messengers reported this back to Tian, Tian opined to Emperor Xianzong that Liu, if transferred elsewhere, would not resist. Soon thereafter, Emperor Xianzong issued an edict commissioning Liu as the military governor of Yicheng Circuit (, headquartered in modern Anyang, Henan). Liu was surprised and decided to submit  and, as soon as he left the city, Tian, approaching with Weibo and other circuits\' troops, met him and gave him the seals of the Yicheng governorship. Liu took with him several colleagues who had unsuccessfully counseled Li Shidao not to resist imperial authority  Li Gongdu (), Li Cun (), Guo Hu (), and Jia Zhiyan ()  with him, and invited them to serve under him at Yicheng. Liu\'s submission to imperial authority was considered the apex of Emperor Xianzong\'s campaign to end warlordism in his realm, referred to historians as the Yuanhe Restoration (, Yuanhe being Emperor Xianzong\'s era name). Emperor Xianzong created Liu the Prince of Pengcheng and awarded him a mansion and an estate. In spring 820, Liu went to Chang\'an to pay homage to Emperor Xianzong.Late in 820, by which time Emperor Xianzong had died and been succeeded by his son Emperor Muzong, Wang Chengzong the military governor of Chengde Circuit (, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei) died. His brother Wang Chengyuan, fearing the fate of Li Shidao, offered to surrender the circuit\'s control to the imperial government. Emperor Muzong, as a result, made a number of transfers of military governors around Chengde  transferring Tian to Chengde, Wang Chengyuan to Yicheng, Liu to Zhaoyi Circuit, and Li Su the military governor of Wuning Circuit (, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), and also making Tian\'s son Tian Bu the military governor of Heyang Circuit (, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan). In 821, after soldiers at Lulong Circuit (, headquartered in modern Beijing) mutinied and put the imperially-commissioned military governor Zhang Hongjing under house arrest and supported the officer Zhu Kerong to take over the circuit, Emperor Muzong made Liu the military governor of Lulong, intending to have him suppress the mutiny, but Liu, fearing the strength of Zhu\'s troops, declined, suggesting that Zhu be commissioned. Emperor Muzong thus allowed Liu to remain at Zhaoyi.Liu Wu thanked Jia for his honest advice and did not kill Liu Chengjie, but instead only kept him under arrest. Emperor Muzong ordered Liu Wu to deliver Liu Chengjie to Chang\'an, and Liu Wu refused, claiming that if he did, the soldiers would mutiny again. At the advice of the chancellor Pei Du, who was also aware of Liu Chengjie\'s arrogance and improper activities, suggested to Emperor Muzong that he ordered that Liu Chengjie be executed, to maintain the faith of not only Liu Wu but other military governors who resented eunuch monitors\' interference with them. Emperor Muzong, however, declined to do so, but at Pei\'s further advice ordered Liu Chengjie exiled. Only after receiving such an order did Liu Wu release Liu Chengjie back into imperial custody. Emperor Muzong subsequently gave Liu Wu the honorary title of acting Situ (, one of the Three Excellencies, as Sikong was). It was said that after this incident, Liu Wu became arrogant and no longer obedient of the imperial government, often gathering bandits to serve under his command. In 823, he was further given the honorary chancellor title of Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi ().Liu Wu died suddenly in 825. A final request to then-reigning Emperor Jingzong (Emperor Muzong\'s son) in Liu Wu\'s name requested that Liu Congjian be allowed to inherit the command. The officials in the imperial government argued among each other about whether Liu Wu\'s son Liu Congjian should be allowed to do so, but finally, with the chancellor Li Fengji and the powerful eunuch Wang Shoucheng in favor, Liu Congjian was allowed to inherit the circuit. Liu Wu was given posthumous honors.'),(9987847,'Poledo','Poledo.Poledo was a Canadian alternative rock band formed in 1994 in Thornhill.

He was killed in 697 in a battle against Khitan\'s khan Sun Wanrong.During Emperor Gaozong\'s reign.It is not known when Wang Xiaojie was born, but it is known that his family was from the vicinity of Tang Dynasty\'s capital Chang\'an. He was said to have had a successful military career during the reign of Emperor Gaozong. In 678, he served under the general Liu Shenli (), the assistant to the chancellor Li Jingxuan in a campaign against Tufan. Li\'s army suffered a great defeat at the hands of the Tufan general Gar Trinring Tsendro (Lun Qinling () in Chinese), and both Liu and Wang were captured by Trinring. When Wang was presented to the Mangsong Mangtsen, the king of Tufan, Mangsong Mangtsen was surprised by Wang\'s appearance and stated, Your appearance is like my father\'s, and began to weep. As a result, he spared Wang and treated him well, finally returning him to Tang. After returning to Tang, Wang continued to serve as a general.During Wu Zetian\'s reign.As of 692, Emperor Gaozong\'s wife Wu Zetian was reigning. At that time, the general Tang Xiujing, who was then the commandant at Xi Prefecture (, roughly modern Turfan Prefecture, Xinjiang), was requested that an army be launched to recover four garrisons that had fallen to Tufan in 670 -- Qiuzi, Yutian, Shule, and Suiye. Because Wang had lived in Tufan for some time, he was considered knowledgeable about Tufan, and Wu Zetian commissioned him to command the army against Tufan, assisted by the general Ashina Zhongjie (). In winter 692, Wang defeated Tufan forces and recaptured the four garrisons.In 694, Wang again achieved victories near Qinghai Lake against Tufan\'s general Gar Tsenyen Gungton (Bolun Zanren () in Chinese) and Western Tujue\'s Shixing Khan Ashina Tuizi (). He was soon made the minister of defense (, Xiaguan Shangshu) and given the designation Tong Fengge Luantai Sanpin (). While serving as chancellor, he was also then commissioned to command an army against Eastern Tujue, formally under the command of Wu Zetian\'s lover Huaiyi, but did not appear to actually engage the Eastern Tujue forces. He was again commissioned to attack Eastern Tujue in 695, but when Tufan attacked later that year, he was commissioned to attack Tufan instead. In 696, when he and fellow chancellor Lou Shide engaged Tufan forces, however, they were defeated by Gar Trinring Tsendro and Trinring\'s brother Gar Tsenba (Lun Zanpo () in Chinese). Lou was demoted, while Wang was reduced to commoner rank.Later that year, however, there was a major Khitan rebellion under Li Jinzhong, who died later that year and was succeeded by his brother-in-law Sun Wanrong. In 697, with Khitan forces penetrating deep into Zhou territory, Wu Zetian commissioned Wang to be the acting commander of an army against Khitan, assisted by Su Honghui (), commanding some 170,000 men. In spring 697, Wang engaged Sun at East Xiashi Valley (, in modern Tangshan, Hebei). Wang himself commanded the forward troops and had initial successes, but as he fought near a cliff, Khitan forces counterattacked, and Su Honghui fled. Wang fell off the cliff and died, and the army suffered heavy losses. Wang\'s secretary Zhang Shuo reported back to Wu Zetian in Luoyang (now capital) and stated, Wang Xiaojie was brave and willing to fight to the death. He faithfully served the empire, fought into enemy territory, and fought many with few. But he had no backup, and so he was defeated. Wu Zetian posthumously honored Wang as the minister of defense and created him the Duke of Geng. She also ordered that Su Honghui be put to death, although before her emissaries arrived, Su had won other battles, and was spared the death penalty.

The culmination of the speculations and findings of German romantic philosophy in the first two-thirds of the 19th century, it became famous. By 1882, it had appeared in nine editions. A three volume English translation appeared in 1884. The English translation is more than 1100 pages long. The work influenced Sigmund Freud\'s and Carl Jung\'s theories of the unconscious.Summary.Hartmann reviews the work of many German philosophers and discusses the ideas of the Indian Vedas, as well as collecting facts about perception, the association of ideas, wit, emotional life, instinct, personality traits, individual destiny, and the role of the unconscious in language, religion, history, and social life. He refers to what Jakob Bhme, Friedrich von Schelling, and Arthur Schopenhauer had called the will as the unconscious. As part of his attempt to reconcile Schopenhauer, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, and other philosophers he argues that the unconscious Absolute is both will and idea, which respectively account for the existence of the world and its orderly nature. Will appears in suffering, idea in order and consciousness. Thus there are grounds for both pessimism and optimism, and, since the Absolute is one, these must be reconciled. As the cosmic process advances, idea prevails over will, making aesthetic and intellectual pleasures possible. Yet intellectual development increases our capacity for pain and material progress suppresses spiritual values. Hence ultimate happiness is unattainable on Earth or heaven, or by progress towards an earthly paradise. These illusions are ruses employed by the absolute to induce mankind to propagate itself. We will eventually shed illusions and commit collective suicide, the final triumph of idea over will.According to Hartmann, the unconscious has three layers: (1) the absolute unconscious, which constitutes the substance of the universe and is the source of the other forms of the unconscious; (2) the physiological unconscious, which like Carus\' unconscious, is at work in the origin, development, and evolution of living beings, including man; (3) the relative or psychological unconscious, which lies at the source of our conscious mental life. Mankind had reached the second stage, with the forces of irrational will competing with rational mind, while misery and civilization would advance until misery and decay reach a climax when the third stage will be possible, the will checked for reason to prevail.Hartmann rejects the theory that dreams are wish-fulfillments, writing, As for dreams, all the little miseries of our waking life also pass over with them into the state of sleep, but not one thing that can at least partly reconcile the cultivated person to life: the enjoyment of science and art...In a chapter on The unconscious in mysticism (chapter IX), Hartmann compared mysticism with philosophy, mentioning some western European authors including Molinos, Fichte, Schopenhauer and Spinoza. He concluded that it was as difficult to distinguish a genuine inspiration of the Unconscious in the waking state when in a mystical mood from freaks of fancy, as to distinguish a clairvoyant dream from an ordinary one, given that, in the one case (the dream) only the result, and in the other (the mood), only the purity and inner worth of the result, could decide between them.Reception.Philosophy of the Unconscious was translated from German into French and English, and went through many editions in all three languages, exerting a great influence on European culture and helping to make the idea of the unconscious familiar and accepted by the close of the 19th century. The work was widely read. Philosophy of the Unconscious received a critical discussion in Franz Brentano\'s Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint (1874); Brentano commented that Hartmann\'s definition of consciousness perhaps referred to something purely imaginary and certainly did not agree with his definition of consciousness.The work has been seen as preparing the way for Freud\'s later theory of the unconscious. Freud consulted Philosophy of the Unconscious while writing The Interpretation of Dreams (1899), in which he called Hartmann the firmest opponent of the theory that dreams are wish fulfillments. Philosopher Hans Vaihinger was influenced by Philosophy of the Unconscious, relating in his The Philosophy of \'As if\' (1911) how it led him to Schopenhauer. Medical historian Henri Ellenberger writes in his The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970) that the main interest of Hartmann\'s work is not its philosophical theories, but its wealth of supporting material. Psychologist Hans Eysenck writes in his Decline and Fall of the Freudian Empire (1985) that Hartmann\'s version of the unconscious is very similar to Freud\'s. Author John Kerr writes that Hartmann\'s ideas about destruction and transformation parallel those of psychoanalyst Sabina Spielrein.English translation.The first English translation by, W.C.Coupland, was published in 1884, with the title Philosophy of the Unconscious, a literal translation of the German title.

Interviewed at Goodreads, Tarttelin says, I could explore gender through the eyes of someone who had no need to define themselves as either male or female, but was pressured to do so by their family and community. She deliberately placed her protagonist within an \'average\' community and a loving family, saying, I often feel characters with alternative genders and sexualities are treated as outsiders in art, when in fact they are us, and they belong inside our communities. I wanted Golden Boy to take place in a town that readers could see as their own town.Tarttelin describes Lianne Simon\'s Confessions of a Teenage Hermaphrodite, and discussions with gender fluid people on Tumblr, as important influences.Synopsis.Max Walker is a golden boy: athletic, attractive and intelligent, from a well to do family. A family with secrets, because Max is intersex. When a childhood friend abuses his trust in a horrific way, the family starts to unravel and, ultimately, seek to try to come to terms with its secrets.Reception.The book has been well received by most reviewers, particularly for young adult audiences: A warmly human coming-of-age story... An important novel, which gives an appealing face to a seldom-seen minority. [Max\'s] desperate search for identity is gripping, emotionally engaging, and genuinely unforgettable, as, indeed, is this accomplished first novel. Clare Calvet of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Nightlife radio program chose Golden Boy as Book of the Week, Golden Boy is an amazing coming of age story. Unique. A dramatic, emotional read. And teachers, please read this powerful page turner. Writing in the Austin Chronicle, Jeanne Thornton writes how the mainstream character dealing with problems of secrecy, rather than anatomy, is way better than some meditation on a mysterious shamanistic figure who has lots to teach us all about gender.Golden Boy has also been well received by intersex audiences. Hida Viloria, director of OII-USA, describes the book as a thoroughly engrossing novel with a pioneering perspective... The novel explores heavy, complex these with a disarming wholesomeness that elicits nostalgia for the novels of adolescence, making it a perfect fit for teen readers as well as adults. Morgan Carpenter at Organisation Intersex International Australia wrote that the story is realistically and eloquently described; it accurately portrays the difficulties in negotiating issues of conformity and autonomy, and the very human need to be true to ones self but also, its arguably intersex lite, the easily comprehended, mainstream, middle-class introduction to intersex that maybe we need it to be.The Evening Standard has reported that Tarttelin is in discussion over film rights.

Imprisoned for debt in 1803 and frowned upon by the government, a decree of 1806 ordered her company to leave the Thtre du Palais-Royal which then bore the name of Varits. The decree\'s aim was to move out Montansier\'s troupe to make room for the company from the neighbouring Thtre-Franais, which had stayed empty even as the Varits-Montansier had enjoyed immense public favour. Strongly unhappy about having to leave the theatre by 1 January 1807, the 77-year-old Montansier gained an audience with Napoleon himself and received his help and protection.

The MCLA provides a governing structure much like the NCAA, with eligibility rules, All-Americans and a national tournament to decide national champions in both Divisions I and II.The MCLA exists to provide a quality college lacrosse experience where varsity NCAA lacrosse does not exist, including at an increasing number of National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) schools. Because the NAIA does not sponsor lacrosse currently, many NAIA schools are using the MCLA as a means of organizing their varsity lacrosse programs. On an individual scale, the MCLA provides rules and a structure that promotes virtual varsity lacrosse, or an experience paralleling that of NCAA programs. While the MCLA provides a high level of athletic competition, it is one of the few governing bodies that does not have a national GPA requirement for its athletes. On a national scale, the MCLA provides the infrastructure to support a level playing field through eligibility rules and enforcement and the use of NCAA rules of play.

Born in Fife, he studied in London and Italy, before gaining a reputation as a portrait painter.Family.Born in Anstruther Easter, he was the first of the five children of John Martin (1699/17001772), Anstruther Easter\'s parish schoolmaster, and his second wife, Mary Boyack (1702?1783).Life.He accompanied the portrait painter Allan Ramsay on his tour of Italy in 17567, having already been taught by him, and after returning became a student at the St Martin\'s Lane Academy in London. There he gained premiums for life drawing in each year from 1759 to 1761. He also joined Ramsay\'s studio as its principal draughtsman, in the 1760s helping to produce many of the coronation portraits of George III and Queen Charlotte.He had his own studio by 1770, by which time he had also produced his first self-portrait (now in the National Gallery of Scotland). It shows him with a clear fair skin, wavy ginger hair, aquiline nose and small red lips. Martin painted over 300 portraits in his lifetime. One of the earliest independent ones is the 1767 one of Benjamin Franklin (now in the White House, Washington, DC). His most influential works depict Scottish Enlightenment figures like the chemist Joseph Black (1787, Scottish National Portrait Gallery) and the philosopher David Hume (1770, now in a private collection), and noblewomen such as the Honourable Barbara Gray (1787). His Dictionary of National Biography entry states that He portrayed his sitters with integrity in an honest natural style, thereby consolidating a recognizably Scottish tradition of portraiture. Martin exhibited at the Incorporated Society of Artists from 1765 to 1777 (being elected its treasurer, vice-president, and president between 1772 and 1777), at the Free Society of Artists in 1767 and at the Royal Academy in 1779 and 1790.He is listed in 1766 as a member of the Society for the Encouragement of the Arts, Manufactures and Commerce, as History Painter, living in Soho Square.As well as producing his own paintings, he copied them himself in highly praised mezzotints such as those of Lady Frances Manners (1772 - impressions of which may be seen in the British Museum, under catalogue entries 1887 0406 87 and 1887 0406 142) and line engravings such as that of William Murray, 1st Earl of Mansfield (an impression of which is held in the Library of Lincoln\'s Inn), as well as producing engravings of landscapes.In 1780, Martin returned to Edinburgh (but not selling his home in High Street, Dartford, until 1782), a move signalled by his admittance to the Royal Company of Archers and a rare full-length portrait he painted of its president, Sir James Pringle of Stichill (17914). In 1785 he was appointed principal painter to the prince of Wales in Scotland. Martin died in 1797 at his home, 4 St James Square, Edinburgh, and was buried in Leith South churchyard on 3 January 1798, with his home contents and studio contents sold at auction in 1799 (in an auction taking 21 days).Family.On 20 July 1771 he married Ann Hill (17431775), but all three of their children died in infancy.'),(47613800,'Zimbabwean_cricket_team_in_Bangladesh_in_2015%E2%80%9316','Zimbabwean cricket team in Bangladesh in 201516.The Zimbabwean cricket team toured Bangladesh in November 2015.

It produces a large poisonous fruit (the football fruit) which can be made edible by fermentation.The taxonomy of the tree is uncertain and it may also be classed in the Flacourtiaceae or the Violales.Ecology and cultivation.The tree requires many years to mature and the seeds are therefore most frequently harvested from wild trees, as it is not economically feasible to cultivate. Although poisonous to humans, the seeds of the tree form part of the natural diet of the babirusa (Babyroussa babyrussa).Culinary uses.The fresh fruit and seeds contain hydrogen cyanide and are deadly poisonous if consumed without prior preparation. The seeds are first boiled and then buried in ash, banana leaves and earth for forty days, during which time, they turn from a creamy white colour to dark brown or black. The method relies on the fact that the hydrogen cyanide released by the boiling and fermentation is water-soluble and easily washed out.The kernels may be ground up to form a thick black gravy called rawon, popular dishes include nasi rawon, beef stew in keluwek paste, and sambal rawon. A stew made with beef or chicken also exists in East Java. The Toraja dish pammarrasan (black spice with fish or meat, also sometimes with vegetables) uses the black keluak powder.

It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992.History.The Queensland Club building was constructed between 1882-84. The club was established in December 1859 following the apparent success of the North Australian Club in Ipswich, and coinciding with the establishment of Queensland as a separate colony. Adopting the British tradition of private clubs for influential members of the community, it provided a recreational venue and accommodation for men of common interests and socio-economic backgrounds. Members were mainly pastoralists, politicians, and business and professional men.The club met initially in small premises in Mary Street. As membership increased, a larger venue was required and in 1881 the club purchased three allotments on the corner of George and Alice Streets, which was known as Hodgsons Corner. FDG Stanley, a member of the club, was appointed architect.The proximity to the seat of government made it an appropriate locale for the new club premises. Stanley\'s plans were modified by the members and finally approved in March 1882. The contractor was J Smith and Sons and the contract sum was 14,150.The building was opened in June 1884 and contained 41 members\' bedrooms, eight bathrooms, a clubroom, dining room, billiard room, smoking room, visitors room, offices and the necessary kitchens, servants rooms and toilets, providing a home away from home for society\'s male elite.In September 1888 the club purchased the adjoining site in Alice Street for 4,000, and stables, laundry and a bottle house were erected. Three years later these buildings were demolished and a bowling green established. The green remained mostly unused and in 1900, it was converted to a tennis court.In 1985 a fire caused damage to the club premises and changes to the room layout of the upper floor bedrooms were carried out in conjunction with the repair work.

Above the third level the building has an open parapet and large ornate urns at the corner of each wing. A classical pediment topped by a finial is located above the entry.The main entry has a large semi-circular fan-light.

Each year\'s National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT) is the qualifying test designated for entry to a particular year\'s competitions.About 1.5 million students in some 22,000 high schools enter the National Merit Scholarship competition annually when they take the Preliminary SAT/National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (PSAT/NMSQT). This serves as an initial screen of program entrants, and measures critical reading ability, mathematics problem solving ability and writing ability, rather than existing knowledge. Semifinalists are designated on a state representational basis, contingent on the total number of entrants and in proportion to each states percentage of the nations high school graduating seniors. Semifinalists are the highest-scoring program entrants in each state and represent the top 0.5% percent of the states senior students.To be considered for a National Merit Scholarship, Semifinalists have to fulfill requirements to advance to Finalist standing. Each Semifinalist submits a detailed scholarship application, which includes essays and information about extracurricular achievements, awards, and leadership positions. Semifinalists also have to have an outstanding academic record, be endorsed and recommended by a school official, and earn SAT scores that confirm their qualifying test performance. From the Semifinalist group, a certain number of students, varying from year to year, advance to Finalist standing depending on the above criteria. By the conclusion of the competition, a select group of Finalists are chosen to receive prestigious National Merit Scholarships totaling nearly $35 million. Winners are the Finalist candidates judged to have the strongest combination of academic skills and achievements, extracurricular accomplishments, and potential for success in rigorous university studies. Scholarship winners represent fewer than 1% of the initial pool of student entrants, based on official statistics released by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation.Program entry requirements.To enter the competition, a student mustPSAT/NMSQT.The NMSC uses the PSAT/NMSQT as the initial screen of over 1.5 million program entrants. In the spring of the junior year, NMSC determines a national Selection Index qualifying score (critical reading + math + writing skills scores) for Commended recognition, which is calculated each year to yield students at about the 96th percentile (top 50,000 highest scorers). Scores in the 200\'s (out of 240) often qualify for recognition, but qualifying levels change annually depending on how the top approximately 50,000 high scorers fared. Qualification levels also vary by state, and qualifying levels are higher in competitive states such as New Jersey and Massachusetts. For the 2009/2010 school year, a score of 217 was required in California to qualify. Notification is mailed to school principals in April regarding students who scored at or above this level. The principals then notify their students of their status. These students are given the opportunity to identify two colleges or universities to which they would like NMSC to send their scores.Semifinalist.Early the next September (beginning of the senior year, almost a year after the PSAT/NMSQT was taken), NMSC determines Selection Index qualifying scores for further recognition by state (including three other areas: DC, US Territories and Commonwealths, and students enrolled in schools outside the US) and US boarding schools (by geographic region). About 16,000 of the 50,000 are recognized as National Merit Semifinalists in this process. The Selection Index qualifying scores for Semifinalist standing vary from state to state and from year to year. Each state is allocated a percentage of Semifinalists based on the percentage of that state\'s graduating seniors out of the nation\'s total. The National Merit Scholarship Corporation does not release to the public the minimum qualifying score required per state. In August after the PSAT was taken, high school principals are mailed notification about their Semifinalists. Principals communicate these results to their students, though some misread the NMSC materials and do not release them until the NMSC press release, which comes in mid-September. Those not making Semifinalist are Commended, and receive a Letter of Commendation; they do not continue in the competition for Merit Scholarship awards.Finalist.Semifinalists must fulfill additional requirements and advance to the Finalist level of the competition to be considered for a scholarship. Approximately 15,000 of the 16,000 Semifinalists advance to Finalist standing by submitting SAT scores that confirm the earlier PSAT/NMSQT performance, having an outstanding academic record, and being endorsed and recommended by a high school official. They must also submit an application that includes high school courses and grades, extracurricular and volunteer activities, and a self-descriptive essay. The information that is collected about each Semifinalist is used later in the process to choose scholarship winners. All Finalists receive a Certificate of Merit in recognition of their outstanding performance in the competition.Scholarships.Of the 15,000 Finalists, about 8,000 receive Merit Scholarship awards. All Finalists are considered for one of the 2,500 National Merit $2,500 Scholarships. National Merit $2500 Scholarship winners are the Finalists in each state judged to have the strongest combination of accomplishments, skills, and potential for success in rigorous college studies. The number of winners named in each state is proportional to the states percentage of the nations graduating high school seniors. These Scholars were selected by a committee of college admissions officers and high school counselors, who appraised a substantial amount of information submitted by both the Finalists and their high schools: the academic record, including difficulty level of subjects studied and grades earned; scores from two standardized tests; contributions and leadership in school and community activities; an essay written by the Finalist; and a recommendation written by a high school official. NMSC\'s own funds support the majority of these awards but corporate sponsors help underwrite these awards with grants they provide to NMSC in lieu of paying administrative fees. About 1,100 Merit Scholarship awards are provided by corporate sponsors for Finalists who meet criteria specified by the sponsor. Most of these awards are for children of the sponsor\'s employees, for Finalists living in a particular geographic area, or for Finalists who have career plans the sponsor wishes to encourage. These two types of awards can be used at any regionally accredited college or university in the United States. There are also approximately 4,600 college-sponsored Merit Scholarship awards for Finalists who plan to attend a sponsor college. Finalists report to NMSC their first choice college (College-Sponsored Merit Awards). In addition, about 1,500 program participants who are below the Finalist level receive Special Scholarships provided by corporate sponsors.Before receiving an award, a Finalist must (a) notify NMSC of plans to enroll in a college or university in the United States that holds accredited status with a regional accrediting commission on higher education, and (b) plan to enroll full-time in an undergraduate course of study leading to a traditional baccalaureate degree. NMSC scholarship stipends are not payable for attendance at service academies, distance learning programs, and certain institutions that are limited in their purposes or training. A number of National Merit Scholars do not receive a monetary award because their educational plans or other awards preclude receipt of a monetary scholarship; however, these students may be honored as Honorary Merit Scholars, a designation that acknowledges achievement without providing any financial assistance.National Achievement Scholarship Program.Black students who meet entry requirements and request consideration when they take the PSAT/NMSQT can enter the National Achievement Scholarship Program as well as the National Merit Program. The two programs are conducted concurrently; however, a student\'s standing in each program is determined independently. Black students can qualify for recognition, become candidates for awards, and be honored as Scholars in both competitions, but they can receive only one monetary award from NMSC. Students who are chosen as both National Achievement and National Merit Scholars receive the monetary award that is most advantageous to them and are recognized as Honorary Scholars in the other program.Steps in the Achievement Scholarship competition are parallel to those in the National Merit Scholarship Program. Of 160,000 entrants, some 3,000 students are referred to colleges for their academic potential and an additional 1,600 students are designated Semifinalists on a regional representation basis. Semifinalists are the highest scorers in the states that make up each region and have an opportunity to continue in the competition for scholarships.Around 1,300 Semifinalists go on to be named Finalists and about 800 receive scholarships. These include 700 National Achievement $2500 Scholarships, most of which are provided by the National Merit Scholarship Corporation, and about 100 corporate-sponsored Achievement Scholarships awards.With the conclusion of the 2015 program, the National Achievement Scholarship Program transitioned to the United Negro College Fund.Notable National Merit and National Achievement Scholars.The following is a list of notable National Merit Scholarship Program honorees, many of whom are listed on the Scholars You May Know page on the National Merit Scholarship Corporation website.Criticism.Under the umbrella of their professional organization, the National Association for College Admission Counseling (NACAC), college and university admissions officers have strongly criticized the National Merit Scholarship Corporation\'s use of only one measurethe PSAT/NMSQTto pre-screen students for National Merit recognition.Implementing the recommendations of its blue-ribbon Testing Commission, the National Association for College Admissions Counseling (NACAC) has called on the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC) and the College Board to stop using PSAT scores as the initial screen for the countrys most prestigious academic awards.In public letters to the tests co-sponsors, NACAC charged that eliminating 99% of test-takers from the National Merit Scholarship competition solely on the basis of a multiple-choice, standardized exam was at odds with best practices in the use of admissions test scores. To be eligible for scholarships, high school juniors must score among the top 1% of test-takers in their home state. The PSAT serves as the National Merit Scholarship Qualifying Test (NMSQT), and measures critical reading ability, mathematics problem solving ability and writing ability, rather than existing knowledge. These criticisms were challenged and refuted by both the College Board and the National Merit Scholarship Corporation.The National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC), which runs the countrys most prestigious tuition aid competition, is trying to block internet posting of state-by-state test score requirements for its awards.FairTest, however, has been criticized for its lack of credentials, unnamed sources of funding, and generalized claims associated with standardized exams.Additional criticism exists in that the National Merit Scholarship Corporation (NMSC) does not publish information regarding scholarship winners by year by state.A number of universities reserve or guarantee additional merit-based funding for students who are National Merit Scholars, finalists or semifinalists. The National Merit Scholarship Corporation releases annual reports displaying the number of award winners enrolled at specific universities, which some believe encourage competition to attract students in this select group. Secondary schools may also publish information related to their students, in order to augment perception on teaching quality.'),(20727696,'United_States_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_Michigan%2C_2010','United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan, 2010.Elections were held on November 2, 2010, to determine Michigan\'s 15 members of the United States House of Representatives.

He graduated through Real Valladolid\'s youth ranks, and made his debut with the first team in a 06 home defeat against FC Barcelona, at the end of the 199192 season. He only missed four league games between 19952000 combined.Snchez signed in 200001 for La Liga giants Real Madrid, initially backing-up wonderkid Iker Casillas. However, the following season, he eventually became first-choice and started five out of nine UEFA Champions League matches during the capital side\'s victorious campaign, but was substituted by Casillas in the final against Bayer 04 Leverkusen after suffering an injury.Zaragoza / Tottenham.In 200506 Csar joined Real Zaragoza, and was everpresent in the Aragonese side\'s lineups during three seasons. In August 2008, after Zaragoza\'s relegation to the second division, new boss Marcelino Garca Toral sidelined the player into the B-team.Shortly after, Snchez was bought by Juande Ramos\'s Tottenham Hotspur. He made his first and only appearance for the London club against Liverpool, in a 42 win for the season\'s Football League Cup, replacing injured Heurelho Gomes.Valencia / Later years.On 20 January 2009 Csar returned to Spain, joining Valencia CF on a free transfer until the end of the season the Che had just lost first-choice Renan to a groin injury, during a 23 loss at Athletic Bilbao. Despite this, Csar was still named on the bench for a Tottenham game on the 21st, the League Cup semifinal second leg against Burnley; two days later Tottenham announced that his contract had been cancelled by mutual consent, and he retained his starting status even when the Brazilian recovered from his injury.After an impressive half-season, Csar (aged almost 38) renewed his link for another year. He started the 200910 campaign on the bench, playing second-fiddle to new signing Miguel ngel Moy; however, after unconvincing displays by the latter, he regained the starting spot, keeping consecutive clean sheets against Racing de Santander (10), defending champions Barcelona (00), UD Almera (30) and Mlaga CF (10).

It is part of the Dublin Region in the province of Leinster. It is named after the former borough of Dn Laoghaire and the barony of Rathdown. Dn Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is the local authority for the county. The population of the county is 206,261 according to the 2011 census.Geography and political subdivisions.Dn LaoghaireRathdown is bordered to the east by the Irish Sea, to the north by the local government area of Dublin City Council, to the west by South Dublin and to the south by County Wicklow. University College Dublin and Dn Laoghaire Institute of Art, Design and Technology are located in the county. It is one of three smaller counties into which County Dublin was divided in 1994. Located to the south-east of Dublin city, its county town is Dn Laoghaire. It is one of the four constituent parts of the Dublin Region. It was created in 1994 by merging the areas under the jurisdiction of the Corporation of Dn Laoghaire and the south-east part of the former Dublin County Council. Additionally, the powers of the former Deansgrange Joint Burial Board were subsumed into the new authority. As part of the Dublin Region, Dn LaoghaireRathdown is within the geographic remit of the Dublin Regional Authority. Following the enactment of the Local Government Act 2001, the Regional Authority was established. It is one of eight such authorities in the state.Terminology and etymology.The name Rathdown is an anglicisation of the Irish Rth an Din, meaning ringfort of the fort. Dn Laoghaire, means Laoghaire\'s fort.In Ireland the word County has traditionally come before rather than after the county\'s name: thus County Clare in Ireland as opposed to Clare County in Michigan, US. However, the counties created after 1994 often drop the word County entirely or use it after the name: for example, internet search engines show many more uses on Irish sites of Dn LaoghaireRathdown than of either County Dn LaoghaireRathdown or Dn LaoghaireRathdown County. There appears to be no official guidance on the matter and the local authority uses all three forms.There is no Rathdown town in the county. The modern county follows virtually the same divisions as the medieval half-barony of Rathdown, a subdivision of County Dublin.While it is the smallest county in Ireland in terms of area, it is also the county with the longest name. Furthermore, the official legal name of the county, in English, is spelt without a sneadh fada on the u in the Irish-language part of the name, Dn Laoghaire (although the current style within the county council is to use the sneadh fada on the name in both Irish and English). The reason for this is that the titles of the new Dublin county councils were never examined at committee stage in the Houses of the Oireachtas, and were last altered under the 1991 Local Government Act which was rushed into effect. Both parliamentary debates and Dublin County Councils own reorganisation report published in 1992 concluded that the name Dun Laoghaire-Rathdown was unacceptable. A one year proviso contained in the 1993 Local Government (Dublin) Act for changing the name of the county at local level was allowed to expire by the new council. The legislation permits the elected members of the council to make representations for additional legislation altering the name of the county.County insignia.The motto on the insignia of the County Council reads,  Chuan go Sliabh, Irish for From Harbour to Mountain. The crown in the device is that of King Legaire mac Nill (Laoghaire, the High King of Ireland in the fifth century, who resided in the area).Local government and politics.Dn LaoghaireRathdown County Council is the local authority for the county. There are six Local Electoral Areas (LEAs) for the county which return a total of 28 councillors as follows: Ballybrack (6), Blackrock (4), Dundrum (6), Dn Laoghaire (6), Glencullen/Sandyford (3), Stillorgan (3).In 1986, the administrative county of Dublin was divided into three electoral counties: Dn Laoghaire-Rathdown, Dublin  Fingal, and Dublin  Belgard.

Feinman (born 1951) is an American archaeologist, and the MacArthur Curator of Mesoamerican, Central American, and East Asian Anthropology at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. He was a part of the Valley of Oaxaca Settlement Pattern Project which focused on the evolution of the Monte Albn state and shifts in settlement in the region over three millennia. He has conducted research in the Valley of Oaxaca, Mexico for over 30 years, most recently in the lands of the communities Tlacolula, Mitla, Matatln, and Ejutla. These studies focused on household excavations at three sites (Ejutla, El Palmillo, and the Mitla Fortress). Most recently, he has begun excavations at Lambityeco in collaboration with representatives of the Mexican Institute of Anthropology and History. At Lambityeco, Feinman and colleagues have documented a large Classic-period ball court, which was not previously recorded during surface mapping of this site.Since 1995 Feinman has also been conducting archaeological survey in coastal Shandong Province, China in conjunction with Shandong University. The coastal Shandong settlement pattern research, spearheaded by Feinman, Linda Nicholas (Field Museum), and Professor Fang Hui (Shandong University) has had a role in introducing this regional-scale systematic field methodology to Chinese archaeology.Feinman is the author of numerous articles, books, and book chapters. He is the co-editor of the Journal of Archaeological Research, past editor of Latin American Antiquity, and a Fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.Contributions to Archaeology.Feinman helped to develop full coverage survey methods, which he and colleagues applied to the Valley of Oaxaca to help understand the evolution of the Monte Alban state The particular method developed by Feinman and colleagues Richard Blanton and Stephen Kowalewski influenced a generation of archaeologists and are still widely used today. Feinman continues to employ and refine this method in his ongoing work in the Valley of Oaxaca and Shandong Province, China.Feinman was an early proponent of world-systems theory, and actively applied it to the evolution of Mesoamerican and Southwestern US polities. Although this work was criticized at the time, it was further developed and employed by many scholars.Feinman also helped to develop dual processual theory, which has had a broad impact in American archaeology.Recent studies, underpinned by a career of regional survey and residential excavation, has offered new perspectives on prehispanic Mesoamerican economies, in which most production for exchange was undertaken in domestic contexts and marketplace exchanges had a central importance. This model is markedly different than prior perspectives that presumed centralized/administered production and exchange. In addition to drawing on results from survey and excavation, Feinman, in conjunction with Linda Nicholas, Mark Golitko and colleagues from Mexico and the United States, has begun an effort to greatly increase the quantity of sourced obsidian from documented prehispanic contexts in the Valley of Oaxaca.By combining these newly sourced sets of obsidian data from Oaxaca with a larger archive of sourced obsidian from across prehispanic Mesoamerica, Feinman and colleagues have documented significant shifts in networks of exchange over time, while casting further doubt on extant models that presume the prevalence of state-controlled economies and redistribution.Feinman is the co-curator of two permanent exhibitions at the Field Museum, the Ancient Americas and the Cyrus Tang Hall of China).'),(731059,'Oulunsalo','Oulunsalo.Oulunsalo is former municipality in the region of Northern Ostrobothnia, in Finland.

It is the third building the county has used for court functions and county administration. It is part of a larger county complex that includes the county jail, administration building and juvenile detention facility.History.Scott County was established in 1837 by the legislature of the Wisconsin Territory. Until this time the area had been a part of Des Moines County. The first court sessions in the county were held in St. Anthony\'s Catholic Church. The juries met in a room that was made available by George Davenport.County Seat election.Davenport and Rockingham, a town a mile south on the Mississippi River, contended for the county seat. An election was held in February 1838. Because the population base at the time was in the southern part of the county, Rockingham was favored. Davenports promoters paid $3,000 in whiskey and bribes to miners from Dubuque, Iowa to vote for Davenport, which won the election. Rockingham contested the election and a new election was set for August 1838. A rule was put in place whereby one had to be a resident for at least 60 days in order to vote in the election. Both towns promoters defrauded the ballot box this time. Laborers were imported to work in the mills at least 60 days before the election and Illinois citizens were invited to vote. When the county commissioners purged the polls after the election Davenport won by two votes. Rockingham again protested and the legislature of the Iowa Territory, of which Scott County had become a part of in 1838, set a new election for the summer of 1840.The third election had four jurisdictions vying for the county seat. Besides Davenport and Rockingham the geographical center of the county, or Sloperville, entered the race as did Winfield, a town along the Mississippi near the mouth of Duck Creek. Sloperville dropped out early. The other three jurisdictions made offers of land, buildings and cash. Winfield offered of land and $100 in labor and materials. Rockingham made an offer to build the courthouse and jail. Davenports promoters, especially Antoine LeClaire and George Davenport, promised to build a courthouse and jail free of charge. Davenport\'s offer of land, cash and building materials was valued at $5,000. The town also stressed its more central location and that its proposed courthouse site was on higher ground away from the Mississippi River, and therefore would not flood. Rockingham and Winfield could not match the offer and Davenport won after Rockingham withdrew on the eve of the election. The election results were celebrated in Davenport with bonfires, fireworks and speeches. Rockingham was later annexed into the city of Davenport, and Winfield is now part of Bettendorf.1842 courthouse.The county\'s first courthouse was a Greek Revival style building built in 1842. It was a two-story structure that featured stately columns and a round cupola. It was located on Bolivar Square, one of the four public squares laid out by Antoine LeClaire when he plotted the town in 1836.1886 courthouse.As the county grew a larger courthouse was needed and an ornate Beaux Arts structure was built in 1886. It was designed by former Davenport architect John C. Cochrane. The building was constructed of Bedford stone. It measured and rose three stories above a raised basement. The large central dome rose to a height of and weighed 11,025 tons. The four corners of the building were marked by turreted towers. The exterior was decorated with elements symbolizing the pioneer experience and life in the Mississippi River Valley. It was built at a cost of $125,000.The courthouse, however, was built on sandy soil and slowly sank. The large vault, which had been built on the ground floor, dropped below ground level. A stairway was constructed down into the vault. Around 1930 termites began to eat away at the wood beams that supported the structure. The building continued to sink into the sandy soil it was built on, which necessitated costly repairs. To help alleviate the weight of the building the dome was removed in 1932. The courthouse continued to sink so the tower wall was torn down the following year. This time 450 tons of brick, which had supported the dome, were removed. Chemicals and other methods were used to get rid of the termites, but they failed. The county made a request for a federal grant of $6,480 to repair and prop up the foundation. It was approved and work began in 1940. Scott County voters approved a $1.5 million bond issue in 1945 to build a new courthouse and the old structure was finally torn down in March 1955. The various county offices moved into rented space in the downtown area.1956 courthouse.The present courthouse was built in 1955 at a cost of $1,480,000. Iowa Governor Leo Hoegh spoke at the dedication on October 21, 1956. In 1983 the courthouse and the Scott County Jail were joined together by an addition to the jail, whose original building was constructed in 1896. A ten-year $13.8 million renovation project began in 1998 after many county offices were moved from the courthouse into a new administration center. Court related offices were moved into newly renovated areas during the project. In 2004 a bond referendum was passed by county voters to expand the size of the jail. The $29.7 million expansion was opened in 2007 and expanded the courthouse and jail complex with a 75,000-square-foot (6,967.73 m) addition. The new entrance pavilion provided security screening to the entire courthouse for the first time.In 2010 the county board of supervisors approved a $176,000 plan to renovate the courthouse\'s 11 court rooms. Renovations include electrical wiring, technology upgrades, painting, replacing carpet and ceiling tiles and asbestos removal.Architecture.The 1956 courthouse itself is a three-story rectangular structure. It was designed in the modern architectural style by Davenport architect Arthur H. Ebeling. Preliminary plans had been prepared by the Des Moines architectural firm of Dougher, Rich & Woodburn. The exterior is clad in aluminum sheets that had been rolled at Alcoa\'s Davenport plant in nearby Riverdale, Iowa. It was the first courthouse in the United States to be clad in aluminum. The building\'s foundation is faced with granite, as is the surround for what served as the buildings main entrance. There are corrugated metal sections between the floors and fixed-pane windows. The building is topped by a flat roof. The interior features of space.

He took part in the Napoleonic wars and specifically, the first Polish campaign (18061807), where he fought with the French at the Siege of Gdask (Danzig) and Siege of Koobrzeg (Kolberg). Between 1808 and 1809 he fought in Spain, including at the Battle of Almonacid and Battle of Ocana. He was appointed as the governor of Malaga, and in 1810 was promoted to Brigadier General.In the 1812 War against Russia (which Napoleon referred to as his Second Polish Campaign) he commanded a cavalry brigade in the 5th Corps of Count Jzef Poniatowski. The Polish poet and playwright Aleksander Fredro, who served under him, recalled that while Sukowski was courageous and honorable, he had trouble acquiring the full confidence of his men, partly because he tended to use infantry tactics (Sukowski\'s previous command) when in charge of a cavalry unit.In the War of the Sixth Coalition he was a division general and led the 4th Cavalry Corps of Micha Sokolnicki. After the death of Poniatowski on 19 October 1813, Sukowski was briefly the main commander of the Polish Corps, even though he was only twenty eight years old at the time. Sukowski however, did not wish to fight outside of Poland again, and acting on behalf of his unit\'s sentiment, vowed that Polish troops would not cross the Rhine. After Napoleon made a personal appeal to Polish soldiers they became willing to follow the emperor which put Sukowski in a difficult position; if he continued to lead his troops he would have to break the oath he made earlier. As a result he submitted his resignation which was accepted by Napoleon and returned to Poland. The remaining Polish forces from then on were commanded by Jan Henryk Dbrowski.Political activity in Congress Poland.After the Congress of Vienna Antoni supported Congress Poland (saying that it was a small and poor version of Poland but Poland nonetheless, and it had that holy name) and Tsar Alexander I of Russia, even becoming his aide-de-camp in September 1815. However, by 1818 he became disillusioned with the political situation, lack of real autonomy or independence for the quasi-Polish state, and the tsar\'s refusal to join lands of the Russian partition to Congress Poland. As a result he resigned his official posts and began focusing on personal matters.In 1818 he settled permanently in Rydzyna (part of the Prussian partition of Poland) and became active in politics. Sukowski was made a member of the Prussian State Council, by King Frederick William and later was a Marshall of the Sejm of the Grand Duchy of Posen and participated in the two founding sejms of the grand duchy in 1827 and 1830. As a prominent politician in the Grand Duchy he tried to protect the use of Polish language and Polish education against forced Germanization and discrimination by the Prussian authorities.During the November Uprising against Russia in Congress Poland in 1830, Sukowski considered joining the insurrection but made a condition of his involvement that he be given his own separate military unit to command. However, personal and family considerations precluded him from following through on this commitment. Nonetheless after the uprising was suppressed he actively campaigned against repression of the insurrectionists and advocated for a general amnesty.He received the Cavalier\'s Cross Virtuti Militari as well as the Officer\'s Cross of Lgion d\'honneur.Personal life.He was the son of Voyevoda of Kalisz Antoni Sukowski (17351796) and Karolina Bubna-Littitz, from a Germanized Czech family. His father was an associate of the Russian general and ambassador, Nicholas Repnin, who was the de facto ruler of Poland at this time. During the Sejm of the First Partition, the elder Sukowski actively supported Russian, Prussian and Austrian partition of Poland and for his service was awarded Order of St. Andrew by Empress Catherine the Great of Russia. Unlike his parents, however, the younger Sukowski became a Polish patriot, supposedly after witnessing the Warsaw Uprising of 1794 against Russian rule as an eight-year-old.He studied in Wrocaw and at the University of Gttingen.In 1808 he married Ewa Kicka, the daughter of the former Chamberlain to the last king of Poland, Stanisaw August Poniatowski. The couple had three daughters; Helena (married Count Henryk Potocki), Ewa (married Count Wadysaw Potocki) and Teresa (married Henryka Wodzicki) and one son, Antoni, who married Maria Mycielska (Antoni\'s wife Ewa died soon after childbirth).In 1836 he caught scarlet fever from one of his children and died. He was buried in a family crypt in the Church of Saint Stanisaw in Rydzyna.Commemoration.Today, in the city of Koobrzeg a major street is named after Sukowski in commemoration of his part in the Siege of the city in 1807.

Ander was trained at the Berliner Staatstheater. Charlotte was a star in the silent era before making the transition to sound. Her film career started in 1920 with the film Die letzte Stunde and Danton (1921). Innumerable starring roles in silent movies and early talkies with super-stars Emil Jannings, Marlene Dietrich, and Hans Albers followed.On 21 February 1927, she created the role of Mascha in the world premiere of Der Zarewitsch by Franz Lehar at the Deutsche Knstler Theater in Berlin, alongside Rita Georg and Richard Tauber, with the composer conducting.She celebrated her greatest success in 1933 with the role of the record shop assistant Nina in Ein Lied geht um die Welt aka A Song Goes Around the World in which she starred with then popular singer Joseph Schmidt and her mother, Ida Perry. In 1933, after the Nazis came to power, because she was not reinrassig or pure-blood, it became difficult for Charlotte to find work. She went to England and made at least two films including Maid Happy (1933), but soon found roles as hard, or harder, to find in England than they had been in Germany.Despite the difficult conditions for her in Nazi Germany, Charlotte returned. She could make a living although not often in front of the cameras. Her only two Nazi era German films were Wie einst im Mai (1937) and Anton, der Letzte (1939). Here fortunes were somewhat better on the stage where she worked until 1950 before returning to the screen in Familie Benthin. Her final film was Das tanzende Herz (1953).'),(37619696,'Falconar_Avia','Falconar Avia.Falconar Avia is a Canadian aircraft manufacturer based in Edmonton, Alberta. The company specializes in the design and manufacture of kits and plans for amateur construction.Founded in the 1960s by aeronautical engineer Chris Falconar, the company created a new aircraft fabric process called Hipec. The company also acquired a large list of aircraft designs that were either orphaned, like the Fauvel AV.36 glider or long out of production and added their own designs to the line. The company provides plans and kits for all their designs as well as parts and modification kits for other aircraft, including the Ercoupe.In 1963 Falconar partnered with designer Marcel Jurca to produce the Jurca Gnatsum. By 1967, Falconar recommended a large number of changes to the design, which resulted in Jurca leaving the project. The modified aircraft was developed as the Falconar SAL Mustang, first flown in 1971 after significant cost overruns. Falconar Aircraft Ltd was sold to George F. Chivers and other investors and operated as Sturgeon Air Ltd with Falconar as an employee until 1973.In 1985 Falconar established a new Falconar Aviation Ltd. with the assets of A & B Sales and the rights to many Jurca plans. Falconar also carried on operations as president of Hirth engines during this time. In 1994 the company was dissolved following legal disputes and was reestablished in its current form as Falconar Avia Inc. in 1995.'),(16732148,'Domestic_violence_in_Peru','Domestic violence in Peru.Domestic violence in Peru is a problem. Abuses are aggravated by insensitivity on the part of law enforcement and judicial authorities toward female victims.Extent.In 2006, Ministry of Women and Social Development (MIMDES) centers reported 25,036 cases of domestic violence in Peru. The centers helped an average of 2,067 men and women per month. MIMDES also operated a toll-free hot line, which handled 7,785 requests for assistance regarding family disturbances during 2006.Women\'s organizations noted that alcohol abuse and traditional attitudes toward women aggravated the problems of rape and sexual abuse - particularly in rural areas. In November 2006, the World Health Organization reported that 69 percent of Peruvian women said they had suffered from some form of physical violence in their lives.MIMDES and NGOs stated that many domestic abuse cases went unreported. NGO sources stated that the majority of reported cases did not result in formal charges because of fear of retaliation or because of the expense of filing a complaint. The legal and physical protections offered were limited because of legal delays, ambiguities in the law, and the lack of shelters for victims.The law.The law prohibits domestic violence, and penalties range from one month to six years in prison. The law gives judges and prosecutors the authority to prevent the convicted spouse or parent from returning to the family\'s home and authorizes the victim\'s relatives and unrelated persons living in the home to file complaints of domestic violence.The law also allows health professionals to document injuries. The law requires police investigation of domestic violence to take place within five days and obliges authorities to extend protection to women and children who are victims of domestic violence.Resources for victims.MIMDES runs the Women\'s Emergency Program, which seeks to address the legal, psychological, and medical problems facing victims of domestic violence. As of 2006 MIMDES operated 39 centers, bringing together police, prosecutors, counselors, and public welfare agents together to help victims of domestic abuse.MIMDES continues efforts to sensitize government employees and the citizenry to domestic violence. In 2006, the Ombudsman\'s Office continued to complain that police officers reacted indifferently to charges of domestic violence, despite legal requirements to investigate the complaints. Also in 2006, female community leaders, former members of congress, and local media outlets launched awareness campaigns to provide citizens with more information about domestic violence.'),(47802357,'1998_New_Zealand_NBL_season','1998 New Zealand NBL season.The 1998 New Zealand National Basketball League season was the 17th running of the competition.
